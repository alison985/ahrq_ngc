	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Gene: <em>CYP2D6</em></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Genetic Test Interpretation</strong></p>
<p>Most clinical laboratories report cytochrome P450 2D6 (<em>CYP2D6</em>) genotype using the star (*) allele nomenclature and may provide interpretation of the patient's predicted metabolizer phenotype. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and other sequence variations, including insertions and deletions, are determined by genetic laboratory tests. The reference SNP number (rs number) for a SNP defines the specific genomic nucleotide alteration. Each star (*) allele (or haplotype) is defined by the presence of a specific combination of SNPs and/or other sequence alterations within the <em>CYP2D6</em> gene locus. The key alleles with their allele-defining SNPs and respective impacts on CYP2D6 enzyme function are provided in Supplementary Table S2 online (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). Genetic results are reported as a diplotype, which includes one maternal and one paternal allele (e.g., <em>CYP2D6*1/*4</em>). In some cases, patients have more than two copies of the <em>CYP2D6</em> gene; up to 13 gene copies have been described. Those alleles are denoted by an &quot;<em>xN</em>&quot; following the allele designation (e.g., <em>CYP2D6*2x2</em> duplication; see Supplementary Data online for details [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). Additional details about allele nomenclature and definitions can be found at <a href=&quot;http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/cyp2d6.htm&quot; title=&quot;The Human Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Allele Nomenclature Database&quot;>http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/cyp2d6.htm</a>, and information regarding the effects of allelic variation on CYP2D6 substrates can be found at the CPIC Web site (<a href=&quot;https://api.pharmgkb.org/v1/download/file/attachment/CYP2D6_allele_definition_table.xlsx&quot; title=&quot;CPIC Web site&quot;>https://api.pharmgkb.org/v1/download/file/attachment/CYP2D6_allele_definition_table.xlsx</a>). <em>CYP2D6</em> allele frequencies differ substantially among racial and ethnic groups. Supplementary Table S1 online summarizes the most important frequencies for various ethnic groups (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p>The combination of alleles is used to determine a patient's diplotype. <em>CYP2D6</em> alleles are characterized as wild-type (normal function), reduced-function, or nonfunctional alleles based on the expected activity of the enzyme that they encode. Each allele is assigned an activity value (i.e., 0 for nonfunctional, 0.5 for reduced-function, or 1.0 for fully functional forms). Supplementary Tables S3 and S4 online (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) describe the activity score values assigned to selected alleles and example diplotypes, respectively. If multiple copies of the <em>CYP2D6</em> gene are detected, the activity score is multiplied by the number of copies of each allele present. The total CYP2D6 activity score is the sum of the values assigned to each allele, which typically ranges from 0 to 3.0 but may exceed 3.0 in rare cases.</p>
<p>The CYP2D6 activity score relates to the phenotype classification system as follows (Table 1 below): patients with an activity score of 0 are poor metabolizers, those with a score of 0.5 are considered intermediate metabolizers, and those with a score of 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 represent a range of extensive metabolizers. Patients with a score &amp;gt;2.0 are classified as ultrarapid metabolizers. The extensive metabolizer phenotype represents normal (wild-type) enzyme activity. The incidence of poor and ultrarapid metabolizers varies greatly among populations (0&amp;ndash;10% and 0&amp;ndash;29%, respectively). Predicted phenotypes of common diplotypes are summarized in Supplementary Table S5 online (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p>Subjects with genotypes giving rise to an activity score of 1.0, which can be due to a diplotype containing one functional and one nonfunctional allele or containing two reduced-function alleles, are classified by some investigators as intermediate metabolizers. Regardless of the term used to describe such individuals (extensive or intermediate metabolizer), their CYP2D6 activity is lower as compared with subjects having two fully functional alleles (with an activity score of 2.0) and higher as compared with subjects having one reduced and one nonfunctional allele (with an activity score of 0.5). Because there is no gold standard for phenotype classification, genotypes that result in CYP2D6 activity scores of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 are grouped together as extensive metabolizers in this guideline based on data specific for codeine metabolism (Supplementary Table S6 online [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]).</p>
<p>Reference laboratories providing clinical <em>CYP2D6</em> genotyping may use varying methods to assign phenotypes. Therefore, it is advisable to note a patient's <em>CYP2D6</em> diplotype and to calculate an activity score before making therapeutic decisions about codeine therapy.</p>

<p><strong>Therapeutic Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Table 2 below summarizes the therapeutic recommendations for codeine based on <em>CYP2D6</em> phenotype. A standard starting dose of codeine, as recommended in the product label, is warranted in patients with an extensive metabolizer phenotype (i.e., a CYP2D6 activity score of 1.0&amp;ndash;2.0). Likewise, a standard starting dose of codeine is warranted in patients with an intermediate metabolizer phenotype (i.e., activity score of 0.5); these patients should be monitored closely for less-than-optimal response and should be offered an alternative analgesic if warranted. If the CYP2D6 substrate tramadol is selected as alternative therapy in intermediate metabolizers, therapy should be monitored closely due to the possibility of poor response.</p>
<p>If clinical genotyping identifies a patient as a <em>CYP2D6</em> poor metabolizer (i.e., activity score of 0), current evidence supports the avoidance of codeine and the use of an alternative analgesic due to the possibility of lack of effect. Use of an analgesic other than the CYP2D6 substrates tramadol, hydrocodone, or oxycodone in poor metabolizers may be preferable. There is insufficient evidence in the literature to recommend a higher dose of codeine in poor metabolizers, especially considering the evidence that select adverse effects do not differ between poor and extensive metabolizers. In a patient identified as a <em>CYP2D6</em> ultrarapid metabolizer (i.e., activity score of &amp;gt;2.0), the choice of another analgesic should be made to avoid the risk of severe toxicity with a &quot;normal&quot; dose of codeine.</p>
<p>To avoid treatment complications, opioids that are not metabolized by <em>CYP2D6</em>, including morphine, oxymorphone, buprenorphine, fentanyl, methadone, and hydromorphone, along with nonopioid analgesics, may be considered as alternatives for use in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and ultrarapid metabolizers based on the type, severity, and chronicity of the pain being treated.</p>
