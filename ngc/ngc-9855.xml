<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Platinum-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is a recognized standard of care for the primary treatment of most patients with locally advanced HNSCC. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) plus platin or monoplatin therapy appear most effective. In patients over age 70, the addition of platinum-based chemotherapy does not appear to provide an overall survival (OS) advantage compared to radiotherapy (RT) alone. </li>
    <li>The addition of cetuximab to intensified RT (concomitant boost or hyperfractionated schedule) may provide an alternative option to CRT. In one randomized controlled trial (RCT), this option demonstrated similar improvements in OS, progression-free survival (PFS), and time to local recurrence compared to RT alone. </li>
    <li>The role of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) therapies in the treatment of locally advanced HNSCC is currently under study in large randomized trials, and patients with HNSCC should continue to be offered clinical trials of novel agents aimed at improving outcomes. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Untreated Recurrent and/or Metastatic HNSCC</strong></p>
<p>Cetuximab in combination with platinum-based combination chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy alone in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC, and is recommended to improve OS, PFS, and response rate in suitable patients.</p>
<p><strong>Previously Treated or Unsuitable for Platinum-based Chemotherapy</strong></p>
<p>Zalutumumab appears to be of benefit in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC who are unsuitable for cisplatin-based chemotherapy or who have had disease progression despite treatment with cisplatin-based chemotherapy.</p></div>"/>

<p>The Evidence-Based Series (EBS) guidelines developed by the Cancer Care Ontario Program in Evidence-based Care (CCO PEBC) use the methods of the Practice Guidelines Development Cycle. For this project, the core methodology used to develop the evidentiary base was the systematic review. Evidence was selected and reviewed by two members of the PEBC Head and Neck Cancer Disease Site Group (DSG) and two methodologists.</p>
<p><strong>Development and Internal Review</strong></p>
<p>An updated Evidence-Based Series (EBS) report was initiated by the Head and Neck Cancer DSG of the CCO PEBC in 2011 and completed in 2011. The series is a convenient and up-to-date source of the best available evidence on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted therapy in head and neck cancer (stage III and IV). It was developed through systematic review, evidence synthesis, and input from practitioners in Ontario. The views and preferences of the target population were not sought for. The original systematic review has been retained in Section 2B of the new series, while new evidence from February 2009 to February 2011 is presented in Section 2A in the original guideline document. The updated Guideline Recommendations are presented in Section 1 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Disease Site Group Consensus Process</strong></p>
<p>The members of the Head and Neck Cancer DSG reviewed the new evidence contained in Section 2A in the original guideline document via email.</p></div>"/>

<p>Prior to the submission of this Evidence-Based Series (EBS) draft report for external review, the report was reviewed and approved by the Program in Evidence-Based Care (PEBC) RAP, which consists of three members: the PEBC director, the Head and Neck Disease Site Group (DSG) chair and an oncologist with expertise in methodological issues.</p>
<p><strong>External Review by Ontario Clinicians</strong></p>
<p>Following the approval of this EBS by the Head and Neck Cancer DSG members and PEBC RAP, the recommendations (see Section 1) and the evidentiary base (see Sections 2A and 2B) in the original guideline document were circulated to external reviewers in Ontario for their feedback.</p>
<p><em>Methods</em></p>
<p>The external review was conducted in two ways; by targeted peer review (TPR) and by professional consultation.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Targeted Peer Review</span></p>
<p>Seven targeted peer reviewers, from Ontario, Alberta, and Vancouver, considered to be clinical experts on the topic, were nominated by the authors. Three of the seven nominees accepted the invitation to be part of the TPR to review this EBS. On July 15th, 2011, the draft report and a five-scale questionnaire were sent to them via email. The questionnaire consists of nine items evaluating the method, results, and interpretative summary used to inform the draft recommendations. Comments from the reviewers are compiled below.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Professional Consultation</span></p>
<p>Feedback was obtained through a brief online survey of health care professionals who are the intended users of the guideline. Medical and radiation oncologists and surgeons working in the field of head and neck cancer in Ontario were identified from the PEBC database and were contacted by email to inform them of the guideline and to solicit their feedback. Participants could participate using a Web survey tool or by hardcopy through regular mail or fax. They were provided with access to the questionnaire, the guideline recommendations (Section 1 in the original guideline document), and a link to the evidentiary base (Section 2 in the original guideline document). Participants were asked to rate the overall quality of the guideline (Section 1 in the original guideline document) and whether they would use and/or recommend it. Written comments were invited.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>This EBS report reflects the integration of feedback obtained through the external review process with final approval given by the Head and Neck Cancer DSG and the Report Approval Panel of the PEBC. Updates of the report will be conducted as new evidence informing the question of interest emerges.</p></div>"/>

    <li>The addition of cetuximab to radiotherapy (RT) in patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) increased overall survival (OS) (median 49.0 months vs. 29.3 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57-0.97, p=0.03) and progression-free survival (PFS) (median 17.1 months vs. 12.4 months; HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54-0.90, p=0.006) as compared with RT alone. Locoregional control (median 24.4 months vs. 14.9 months; HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52-0.89, p=0.005) and objective response rate (74% vs. 64%; odds ratio [OR] for response 0.57, 95% CI 0.36-0.90, p=0.02) were also significantly improved. </li>
    <li>In one reported study, the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin plus 5-fluorouracil) improved OS (10.1 months vs. 7.4 months, p=0.04), PFS (5.6 months vs. 3.3 months, p&amp;lt;0.001) and response rate (36% vs. 20%, p&amp;lt;0.001) compared to chemotherapy alone in patients with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC. </li>
    <li>In a small randomized trial, the addition of cetuximab to cisplatin improved the objective response rate (26% vs. 10%, p=0.03) but did not improve OS (9.2 months vs. 8.0 months, p=0.21) or PFS (4.2 months vs. 2.7 months, p=0.09), although the trial was inadequately powered to assess these outcomes. </li>
    <li>In one trial, PFS was shown to be significantly better in patient treated with zalutumumab than those on best supportive care (BSC) (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.84; p=0.001). The improvement seen in OS (6.7 months versus 5.2 months) was not statistically significant (p=0.062). Zalutumumab was given in escalating doses until the patient developed a rash. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Cetuximab did not appear to increase common adverse effects that can occur during radiotherapy (RT). The most common and significant side effects (grades 3-5) of cetuximab were acneiform rash (17% vs. 1%, p&amp;lt;0.001) and infusion reaction (3% vs. 0%, p=0.01). Quality of life (QoL) was neither clearly improved nor worsened by the addition of cetuximab to RT. </li>
    <li>Hypomagnesemia was increased in patients receiving cetuximab in combination with cisplatin. </li>
    <li>Gefitinib was associated with an increased incidence of tumour hemorrhage as compared with weekly methotrexate (8.9% for 250mg/d and 11.4% for 500 mg/d vs. 1.9% for methotrexate). </li>
    <li>Concurrent chemotherapy is not only associated with additional adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, and neutropenia but also with severe oropharyngeal mucositis in over 50% of patients. The latter represents a serious challenge to the quality of life, costs, and management of these patients. </li>

    <li>Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is the current standard of care for many patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and, to date, there is not adequate evidence for assessing comparisons of cetuximab plus radiotherapy (RT) to CRT or examining whether the addition of cetuximab to CRT is of benefit to these patients. However, there are six ongoing trials investigating the effect of the addition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, concurrently with, prior to, or following CRT, on overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and time to local recurrence in these patients, which should determine whether cetuximab should be added to standard of care treatment. </li>
    <li>Postoperative CRT is also a standard of care for high-risk patients with HNSCC treated with primary surgery, and no evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is available to support the use of cetuximab plus RT in this setting. </li>
