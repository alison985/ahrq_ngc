	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Diagnosis of Ocular Complications of Diabetes Mellitus</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Individuals with Undiagnosed Diabetes Mellitus</strong></p>
<p><em>Ocular Examination</em></p>
<p>The ocular examination of an individual suspected of having undiagnosed diabetes should include all aspects of a comprehensive eye examination* with supplemental testing, as noted in the original guideline document.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*Refer to the <a href=&quot;http://www.aoa.org/documents/optometrists/CPG-1.pdf&quot; title=&quot;American Optometric Association Web site&quot;>Optometric Clinical Practice Guideline for Comprehensive Adult Eye and Vision Examination</a>.</p>
<p>Persons without a diagnosis of diabetes who present with signs suggestive of diabetes during the initial examination should be referred to their primary care physician for evaluation, or an A1C test or fasting blood glucose analysis may be ordered.</p>
<p><strong>Individuals with Diagnosed Diabetes Mellitus</strong></p>
<p>The ocular examination of a person with diabetes should include all aspects of a comprehensive eye examination,* with supplemental testing, as indicated, to detect and thoroughly evaluate ocular complications.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*Refer to the <a href=&quot;http://www.aoa.org/documents/optometrists/CPG-1.pdf&quot; title=&quot;American Optometric Association Web site&quot;>Optometric Clinical Practice Guideline for Comprehensive Adult Eye and Vision Examination</a>.</p>
<p>Patients should be questioned about the awareness of their personal diabetes ABCs (A1C, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels and their history of smoking).</p>
<p><em>Ocular Examination</em></p>
<p>The initial ocular examination should include, but is not limited to, the following evaluations:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Review of patient medical history </li>
    <li>Best-corrected visual acuity </li>
    <li>Pupillary reflexes </li>
    <li>Ocular motility </li>
    <li>Refractive status </li>
    <li>Confrontation visual field testing or visual field evaluation </li>
    <li>Slit lamp biomicroscopy </li>
    <li>Tonometry </li>
    <li>Dilated retinal examination </li>
</ul>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Dilated Retinal Examination</span></p>
<p>Retinal examinations for diabetic retinopathy should be performed through a dilated pupil.</p>
<p>When vitreous hemorrhage prevents adequate visualization of the retina, prompt referral to an ophthalmologist experienced in the management of diabetic retinal disease should be made for further evaluation.</p>
<p>The individual's primary care physician should be informed of eye examination results following each examination, even when retinopathy is minimal or not present.</p>
<p><strong>Ocular Examination Schedule</strong></p>
<p><em>Persons with Diabetes Mellitus</em></p>
<p>As diabetes may go undiagnosed for many years, any individual with type 2 diabetes should have a comprehensive dilated eye examination soon after the diagnosis of diabetes (American Diabetes Association, 2013).</p>
<p>Individuals with diabetes should receive at least annual dilated eye examinations. More frequent examination may be needed depending on changes in vision and the severity and progression of diabetic retinopathy.</p>
<p>Women with pre-existing diabetes who are planning pregnancy or who become pregnant should have a comprehensive eye examination prior to a planned pregnancy or during the first trimester, with follow-up during each trimester of pregnancy.</p>
<p><em>Persons with Non-retinal Ocular Complications of Diabetes Mellitus</em></p>
<p>Examination of persons with non-retinal ocular complications of diabetes should be consistent with current recommendations of care for each condition.</p>
<p><em>Persons with Retinal Complications of Diabetes Mellitus</em></p>
<p>Prompt referral to a vitreo-retinal surgeon is indicated when a vitreous hemorrhage, a retinal detachment or other evidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy is present.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Treatment and Management</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Management of Ocular Complications of Diabetes Mellitus</strong></p>
<p><em>Basis for Treatment</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Persons with Non-retinal Ocular Complications</span></p>
<p>Treatment protocols for persons with non-retinal ocular and visual complications should follow current recommendations for care, and include education on the subject and recommendations for follow-up visits.</p>
<p>As part of the proper management of diabetes, the optometrist should make referrals for concurrent care when indicated.</p>
<p><em>Treatment of Retinal Complications</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Laser Photocoagulation</span></p>
<p>Non-proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR)</p>
<p>Panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) may be considered in patients with severe or very severe NPDR, or early proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) with a high risk of progression (e.g., pregnancy, poor glycemic control, inability to follow-up, initiation of intensive glycemic control, impending ocular surgery, renal impairment and rapid progression of retinopathy) (Mohamed, Ross, &amp;amp; Chu, 2011). (<strong>A/A</strong>)</p>
<p>Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy</p>
<p>Patients with high-risk PDR should receive referral to an ophthalmologist experienced in the management of diabetic retinal disease for prompt scatter PRP (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Research Group [ETDRS], 1991; Chew et al., 2003). (<strong>A/A; B/B</strong>)</p>
<p>Eyes in which PDR has not advanced to the high-risk stage should also be referred for consultation with an ophthalmologist experienced in the management of diabetic retinal disease (ETDRS, 1991; Chew et al., 2003). (<strong>A/A; B/B</strong>)</p>
<p>Following successful treatment with PRP, patients should be re-examined every 2 to 4 months. The follow-up interval may be extended based on disease severity and stability.</p>
<p>Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)</p>
<p>Following focal photocoagulation for DME, re-examination should be scheduled in 3 to 4 months.</p>
<p>Patients with center-involved DME should be referred to an ophthalmologist experienced in the management of diabetic retinal disease for possible treatment.</p>
<p>Individuals with DME, but without clinically significant macular edema (CSME), should be re-examined at 4- to 6-month intervals. Once CSME develops, treatment with focal laser photocoagulation or intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injection is indicated (Mohamed, Ross, &amp;amp; Chu, 2011). (<strong>A/A</strong>)</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Vitrectomy</span></p>
<p>Eyes with vitreous hemorrhage (VH), traction retinal detachment (TRD), macular traction or an epiretinal membrane should be referred to an ophthalmologist experienced in the management of diabetic retinal disease for evaluation for possible vitrectomy.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Inhibitors</span></p>
<p>The current standard of care for treatment of center-involved DME in persons with best corrected visual acuity of 20/32 or worse, is anti-VEGF injections (Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network, 2008; Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network et al., 2010). (<strong>A/A</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Patient Education</em></p>
<p>Persons should be educated about the ocular signs and symptoms of diabetic retinopathy and other non-retinal complications of diabetes, and encouraged to comply with recommendations for follow-up eye examinations and care.</p>
<p>Individuals should be advised of the risks of smoking related to diabetes and encouraged to quit smoking and/or seek smoking cessation assistance.</p>
<p>Individuals should be educated about the long-term benefits of glucose control in saving sight, based on their individual medically appropriate A1C target.</p>
<p><strong>Management of Systemic Complications and Co-morbidities of Diabetes Mellitus</strong></p>
<p><em>Glycemic Control</em></p>
<p>The glycemic goal for persons with diabetes should be individualized, taking into consideration their risk of hypoglycemia, anticipated life expectancy, duration of disease and co-morbid conditions (American Diabetes Association, 2013).</p>
<p>Optometrists should have a rapid-acting carbohydrate (e.g., glucose gel or tablets, sugar-sweetened beverage or fruit juice) in their office for use with diabetes patients who experience acute hypoglycemia during an eye examination.</p>
<p><em>Lipid-Lowering Treatment</em></p>
<p>The majority of persons with diabetes are at risk of coronary heart disease and can benefit from reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels to the currently recommended targets (Knopp et al., 2006). (<strong>B/B</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Weight Management</em></p>
<p>When indicated, overweight individuals should be referred to a qualified health care provider for assistance with weight loss.</p>
<p><em>Treatment Modalities</em></p>
<p>Individuals with diabetes should receive nutrition and dietary recommendations preferably provided by a registered dietician who is knowledgeable about diabetes management.</p>
<p><strong>Management of Persons with Visual Impairment</strong></p>
<p>Individuals who experience vision loss from diabetes should be provided, or referred for, a comprehensive examination of their visual impairment by a practitioner trained or experienced in vision rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Persons with diabetes who experience visual difficulties should be counseled on the availability and scope of vision rehabilitation care and encouraged to utilize these services.</p>
<p>Referral for counseling is indicated for any individual experiencing difficulty dealing with vision and/or health issues associated with diabetes or diabetic retinopathy. Educational literature and a list of support agencies and other resources should be made available to these individuals.</p>

    <li>Complications and side effects of panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) include visual field constriction, night blindness, color vision changes, decreased accommodation, scotoma, anisocoria, glaucoma and traction retinal detachment. PRP may worsen retinal thickening in some patients with center-involved macular edema. Since the relative risk of vision loss in patients without high-risk characteristics is low, treatment of clinically significant macular edema (CSME) or center-involved diabetic macular edema (DME) should be considered before panretinal laser photocoagulation is used. </li>
    <li>Potential complications of vitrectomy include neovascular glaucoma, retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal tear formation, cataract and endophthalmitis. Glaucoma is more likely to occur in people with associated preoperative retinal detachment. </li>
    <li>The use of intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA) has been associated with the risk of elevated intraocular pressure and the rates of visually significant cataracts were substantially higher compared to eyes receiving focal/grid laser treatment. </li>
    <li>Long-term systemic&amp;nbsp;vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition can result in increased risk of ischemic and thromboembolic events. </li>
    <li>Ocular adverse events resulting from the intravitreal injection itself include endophthalmitis, ocular inflammation, retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage and traumatic cataract. </li>
    <li>Bevacizumab (Avastin&amp;reg;) is approved for treatment of cancer and its systemic use is known to be associated with an increased risk of stroke. It is unknown if a substantially smaller dose, when used intravitreally, has any significant systemic toxicity. It is used off-label for the treatment of DME. </li>
    <li>Clinicians should use caution in administering topically applied drugs for pupillary dilation in pregnant women. Topically applied drugs for pupillary dilation, such as tropicamide, hydroxyamphetamine and phenylephrine are Pregnancy Category C drugs. </li>
