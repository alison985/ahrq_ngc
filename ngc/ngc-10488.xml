	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Recommendation</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Level III</strong></p>
<p>Treatment with bevacizumab is recommended as it provides improved disease control compared to historical controls as measured by best imaging response and progression free survival at 6 months.</p>
<p>Given that there are a large number of therapies are available for progressive glioblastoma that may be applied under selected circumstances dependent on patient characteristics and treating physician judgment, it is strongly recommended that patients with progressive glioblastoma be enrolled in properly designed clinical investigations to provide convincing evidence of therapeutic value.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Definition</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Classification for Therapeutic Studies</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: Evidence provided by one or more well-designed randomized controlled clinical trials, including overview (meta-analyses) of such trials</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: Evidence provided by well-designed observational studies with concurrent controls (e.g., case control and cohort studies)</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: Evidence provided by expert opinion, case series, case reports and studies with historical controls</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Classification for Diagnostic Studies</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: Evidence provided by one or more well-designed clinical studies of a diverse population using a &quot;gold standard&quot; reference test in a blinded evaluation appropriate for the diagnostic applications and enabling the assessment of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and where applicable, likelihood ratios</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: Evidence provided by one or more clinical studies of a restricted population using a &quot;gold standard&quot; reference test in a blinded evaluation of diagnostic accuracy and enabling assessment of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and where applicable, likelihood ratios</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: Evidence provided by expert opinion, studies that do not meet the criteria for the delineation of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and where applicable, likelihood ratios</p>
<p><strong>Levels of Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level 1</strong>: Generally accepted principles for patient management, which reflect a high degree of clinical certainty (usually this requires Class I evidence which directly addresses the clinical questions or overwhelming Class II evidence when circumstances preclude randomized clinical trials)</p>
<p><strong>Level 2</strong>: Recommendations for patient management which reflect clinical certainty (usually this requires Class II evidence or a strong consensus of Class III evidence)</p>
<p><strong>Level 3</strong>: Other strategies for patient management for which the clinical utility is uncertain (inconclusive or conflicting evidence or opinion)</p></div>"/>

Specifically that included progressive, recurrent, or relapsing glioma or glioblastoma and combined with targeted therapy and molecular agents and then quality of life, survival and mortality. The search strategy is documented in the companion document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). Reference lists of included studies were also reviewed.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Writing groups were created from the entire clinical guideline panel based on expertise to address each of the disciplines and areas of therapy chosen to be part of this set of clinical guidelines. Each group was involved with literature selection, creation and editing of the evidence/summary tables for their specific discipline. Using this information, the writing groups then drafted the clinical practice guideline for their respective discipline. The draft guidelines were then circulated to the entire clinical guideline panel for feedback, discussion, and ultimately approval.</p>
<p>Both the evidence classification and the strength of the recommendations were graded according to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS)/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; and &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; fields). The class of evidence assigned to each study was based on study design (i.e., class I, II, or III). The strength of the recommendations made (i.e., level 1, 2, or 3) was directly linked to the evidence classification and took into account aspects of study quality and whether or not the plan was accomplished, not just study design. Specifically, the level of a recommendation made could be decreased, based on consensus input, if there were methodological concerns regarding the studies that provided evidence for that particular recommendation.</p>
<p>See Figure 1 in the methodology document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for an outline of the key steps in the process of developing these clinical practice guidelines.</p></div>"/>
