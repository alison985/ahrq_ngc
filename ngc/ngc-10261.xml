	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Whenever possible, patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) should be considered for eligibility in ongoing clinical trials. </li>
    <li>Patients with a solitary metastasis as the basis for stage IV disease with good performance status and otherwise resectable and limited thoracic disease may benefit from more aggressive management, including surgical intervention and/or stereotactic radiotherapy. </li>
    <li>Combination chemotherapy consisting of a platinum-based doublet is the standard of care for first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC (except for epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]-positive patients; see recommendation 6 below). The combination of three chemotherapeutic agents for the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC is not routinely recommended based on current evidence. </li>
    <li>Therapy should be continued for four cycles in most patients, and not more than six cycles in responding patients. </li>
    <li>Acceptable alternatives to combination chemotherapy include non-platinum doublets or monotherapy:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>For patients with a borderline performance status (PS=2), single-agent chemotherapy with vinorelbine, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel or pemetrexed (for non-squamous cell carcinoma patients only) is recommended over best supportive care alone. </li>
        <li>For elderly patients who cannot tolerate a platinum-based combination, single-agent chemotherapy with vinorelbine, gemcitabine, docetaxel, or pemetrexed (for non-squamous cell carcinoma patients only) is associated with improved survival and quality of life when compared to best supportive care alone. However, elderly patients with a good performance status (PS=0-1) should receive combination chemotherapy with a platinum-based doublet. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>First-line monotherapy with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib is recommended for patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. </li>
    <li>Testing for EGFR mutations should take place for all eligible patients with advanced NSCLC and adenocarcinoma (including adenosquamous) histology who are being considered for first-line therapy with gefitinib, irrespective of their gender, ethnicity, and smoking status. </li>
    <li>Second-line or subsequent chemotherapy options for advanced NSCLC include single-agent docetaxel or erlotinib for patients with squamous cell carcinoma histology, or single agent treatment with a drug that has not been previously used. </li>
    <li>Crizotinib has been approved for second-line treatment of patients who are positive for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearrangements from the pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review (pCODR) and has also been approved for provincial coverage in Alberta. </li>
    <li>Testing for ALK mutations should take place for all eligible patients with advanced NSCLC and adenocarcinoma (including adenosquamous) histology who are being considered for second-line therapy with crizotinib. </li>
    <li>Palliative radiotherapy is recommended for relief of specific symptoms and prophylactic prevention of symptom development. </li>

<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>What is the recommended first-line therapy for patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)? </li>

    <li>What is the role of palliative radiotherapy in the management of patients with stage IV NSCLC? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>For the November 2013 guideline update, the treatment algorithm (see the original guideline document) was updated to reflect newly approved provincial coverage of both anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) testing and crizotinib for second-line treatment of ALK-positive patients, to describe how this new treatment fits in with overall care for lung cancer patients, and to reflect the specific indications (second-line therapy after a failed platinum doublet regimen).</p>
<p>For the January 2013 guideline update, the working group conducted a search for new or updated practice guidelines published since February 2011 by accessing the Web sites of the following organizations: Cancer Care Ontario, the British Columbia Cancer Agency, Cancer Care Nova Scotia, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, and the European Society for Medical Oncology.</p>
<p>Medical journal articles were searched using the EMBASE (2011 to January 2013) and PubMed (February 2011 to January 2013) electronic databases; the references and bibliographies of articles identified through these searches were scanned for additional sources. The PubMed search terms were: treatment [MeSH heading] AND stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. The search was limited to the following publication types: humans, adult 19+ years, English, clinical trial, comparative study, controlled clinical trial, guideline, meta-analysis and practice guideline. This search strategy was modified as necessary and repeated in each of the other electronic databases. The working group excluded articles from the final review if they had a non-English abstract, were not available through the library system, or were published prior to 2011.</p>
<p>The working group reviewed the currency and acceptability of all relevant literature and updated published guidelines for the treatment for stage IV NSCLC.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Evidence was selected and reviewed by a working group comprised of members from the Alberta Provincial Thoracic Tumour Team and a Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist from the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU). A detailed description of the methodology followed during the guideline development process can be found in the GURU Handbook (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Tables</strong></p>
<p>Evidence tables containing the first author, year of publication, patient group/stage of disease, methodology, and main outcomes of interest are assembled using the studies identified in the literature search. Existing guidelines on the topic are assessed by the KM Specialist using portions of the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument (<a href=&quot;http://www.agreetrust.org&quot; title=&quot;AGREE Web site&quot;>http://www.agreetrust.org</a>) and those meeting the minimum requirements are included in the evidence document. Due to limited resources, GURU does not regularly employ the use of multiple reviewers to rank the level of evidence; rather, the methodology portion of the evidence table contains the pertinent information required for the reader to judge for himself the quality of the studies.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Formulating Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The working group members formulated the guideline recommendations based on the evidence synthesized by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist during the planning process, blended with expert clinical interpretation of the evidence. As detailed in the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit Handbook (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field), the working group members may decide to adopt the recommendations of another institution without any revisions, adapt the recommendations of another institution or institutions to better reflect local practices, or develop their own set of recommendations by adapting some, but not all, recommendations from different guidelines.</p>
<p>The degree to which a recommendation is based on expert opinion of the working group and/or the Provincial Tumour Team members is explicitly stated in the guideline recommendations. Similar to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) methodology for formulating guideline recommendations, the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit does not use formal rating schemes for describing the strength of the recommendations, but rather describes, in conventional and explicit language, the type and quality of the research and existing guidelines that were taken into consideration when formulating the recommendations.</p>

<p>When the draft guideline document has been completed, revised, and reviewed by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist and the working group members, it is sent to all members of the Provincial Tumour Team for review and comment. This step ensures that those intended to use the guideline have the opportunity to review the document and identify potential difficulties for implementation before the guideline is finalized. Depending on the size of the document, and the number of people it is sent to for review, a deadline of one to two weeks will usually be given to submit any feedback. Ideally, this review will occur prior to the annual Provincial Tumour Team meeting, and a discussion of the proposed edits will take place at the meeting. The working group members will then make final revisions to the document based on the received feedback, as appropriate. Once the guideline is finalized, it will be officially endorsed by the Provincial Tumour Team Lead and the Executive Director of Provincial Tumour Programs.</p></div>"/>
