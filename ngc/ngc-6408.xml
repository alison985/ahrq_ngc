	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

ArchiveBot's source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot">https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot</a>.

    <field fieldid="153" ordby="710" id="429" name="Potential Harms" type="text">
      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Hospitalization of patients with problematic behavior and delirium may be traumatic for the patient. Hospital staff may not be familiar with the patient's history and symptoms, understand what triggers the problematic behavior, or be aware of the environment in which the patient functions. Frequently, hospitalization omits vital supportive care or relevant nonpharmacologic approaches and may result in undesirable changes in the patient's medication regimen. Many patients have a recurrence of problematic behavior after hospitalization, and repeat hospital transfers may not be any more helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Adverse Effects of Medications</strong></p>

<ul type=&quot;disc&quot;>
<li>Unwarranted or unnecessarily prolonged <em>antibiotic</em> treatment is a widespread concern. Antibiotics can lead to additional complications (e.g., anorexia- or diarrhea-related fluid loss) that can contribute to impaired mental function or to the development of resistant organisms.</li>

<li>All <em>antipsychotics</em> should be used cautiously, and their risks identified and documented, in patients with cerebrovascular risk factors. Patients who have dementia with Lewy bodies generally have an increased sensitivity to antipsychotics. Second-generation antipsychotics may have a lower frequency of extrapyramidal side effects such as parkinsonism or tardive dyskinesia, but all antipsychotics have some significant associated risks.&amp;nbsp; Also, antipsychotics may exacerbate symptoms in patients with Lewy body dementia. All antipsychotic medications have the potential to induce akathisia, a sense of motor restlessness that can result in pacing, physical agitation, and complaints of leg and thigh discomfort.</li>

<li>In April 2005, the FDA issued an overall health advisory concerning an increased risk of death in patients with dementia who are treated with second-generation (so-called &amp;quot;atypical&amp;quot;) antipsychotics. This warning has since been expanded to include all antipsychotic medications. For example, warnings about the use of <em>haloperidol</em> have been revised to include cases of sudden death due to impairment of cardiac conduction in patients treated with this agent, especially when the medication is given intravenously (a common but hazardous off-label use) or at doses higher than recommended.</li>

<li>When inappropriately prescribed for patients with problematic behavior due to other causes, <em>antidepressants</em> may exacerbate symptoms. Excessive serotonin stimulation due to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, alone or in combination with other medications that affect serotonin levels) can lead to agitation, delirium, seizures, other psychiatric symptoms, or death (&amp;quot;serotonin syndrome&amp;quot;). The concurrent use of several antidepressants for diverse symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety, pain, appetite stimulation, and insomnia) may also increase the risk for adverse consequences such as falls and serotonin syndrome. Unless another medication in the same class is being substituted, withdrawing antidepressants too rapidly may cause behavioral symptoms that can be mistaken for a return of the underlying condition.</li>

<li>Adverse consequences of <em>cholinesterase inhibitors</em> can include hallucinations, confusion, and agitation, and those for <em>memantine</em> may include fatigue, headache, and hypertension. Cholinesterase inhibitors can also cause anorexia and other gastrointestinal symptoms that eventually lead to weight loss.</li>

<li>Medications with <em>anticholinergic effects</em> can cause problematic behavior and may counteract the effectiveness of cholinesterase inhibitors. Therefore, it is important to review the medication regimen and reduce or eliminate medications with anticholinergic properties or side effects, whether or not cholinesterase inhibitors are being given.</li>

<li><em>Divalproex</em> sodium and other earlier-generation <em>anticonvulsants</em> are associated with significant side effects, such as sedation. <em>Lamotrigine</em> may have fewer significant side effects than the earlier-generation anticonvulsants.</li>

<li>Inappropriate use of <em>benzodiazepines</em> to try to manage patients with delirium and psychosis may permit symptoms to progress and may lead to the use of additional inappropriate and ineffective medications or to avoidable hospitalization. All benzodiazepines are associated to some degree with adverse consequences such as increased confusion, sedation, falls, and hip fractures in a susceptible population. In addition, they may cause increased agitation, insomnia, and other side effects. Tolerance occurs rapidly with short half-life benzodiazepines. Short-half-life benzodiazepines such as lorazepam, which are often used to treat patients with psychosis, delirium, and nonspecific agitated or combative behavior, are best avoided. They are often ineffective and commonly cause oversedation and &amp;quot;rebound&amp;quot; effects (anxiety and insomnia) after each dose.</li></ul></div>"/>

<li><strong>Recognition</strong>

<ul type=&quot;disc&quot;>
<li>Define the area of improvement and determine if there is a CPG available for the defined area. Then evaluate the pertinence and feasibility of implementing the CPG</li></ul>

<li><strong>Implementation</strong>

<li>Identify individual responsible for each step of the CPG</li>
<li>Identify support systems that impact the direct care</li>

<li>Evaluate the predefined performance measures and obtain and provide feedback</li></ul>
