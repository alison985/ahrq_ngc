<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>b</sup>*X = any <em>HLA-B</em> genotype other than <em>*57:01</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Therapeutic Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors agree with others that <em>HLA-B*57:01</em> screening should be performed in all abacavir-naive individuals before initiation of abacavir-containing therapy (see the table below); this is consistent with the recommendations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the European Medicines Agency. In abacavir-naive individuals who are <em>HLA-B*57:01</em>-positive, abacavir is not recommended and should be considered only under exceptional circumstances when the potential benefit, based on resistance patterns and treatment history, outweighs the risk. <em>HLA-B*57:01</em> genotyping is widely available in the developed world and is considered the standard of care prior to initiating abacavir. Where <em>HLA-B*57:01</em> genotyping is not clinically available (such as in resource-limited settings), some have advocated initiating abacavir, provided there is appropriate clinical monitoring and patient counseling about the signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reaction (HSR), although this remains at the clinician's discretion.</p>
<p>There is some debate among clinicians regarding whether <em>HLA-B*57:01</em> testing is necessary in patients who had previously tolerated abacavir chronically, discontinued its use for reasons other than HSR, and are now planning to resume abacavir. The presence of <em>HLA-B*57:01</em> has a positive predictive value of ~50% for immunologically confirmed hypersensitivity, indicating that some <em>HLA-B*57:01</em>-positive individuals can be, and have been, safely treated with abacavir. However, the guideline authors were unable to find any data to show that <em>HLA-B*57:01</em>-positive individuals with previous, safe exposure to abacavir had zero risk of HSR upon re-exposure. Although there are isolated case reports of previously asymptomatic patients developing a hypersensitivity-like reaction after restarting abacavir, there were confounding circumstances. Many of the patients had complicating concomitant illnesses that could have masked an HSR during initial abacavir therapy, and none were immunologically confirmed, making the case reports difficult to interpret. Furthermore, most of these case reports precede the availability of <em>HLA-B*57:01</em> genetic testing, making it impossible to determine from the published data whether there could be a risk of HSR upon re-exposure to abacavir in previously asymptomatic <em>HLA-B*57:01</em>-positive patients.</p>
<p>In addition, there may also exist a small group of patients who have been on chronic abacavir therapy since before the introduction of <em>HLA-B*57:01</em> genotyping. Given that virtually all abacavir HSR events occur within the first several weeks of therapy, and that ~50% of <em>HLA-B*57:01</em> carriers can safely take abacavir, the guideline authors were unable to find any evidence to suggest that <em>HLA-B*57:01</em>-positive individuals on current, long-term, uninterrupted abacavir therapy are at risk of developing HSR. Existing clinical guidelines have a blanket recommendation that all <em>HLA-B*57:01</em>-positive individuals should avoid abacavir, regardless of patient history. Although <em>HLA-B*57:01</em> genotyping has proven utility in significantly reducing the incidence of both clinically diagnosed and immunologically confirmed hypersensitivity in patients being newly considered for abacavir therapy, the connection between <em>HLA-B*57:01</em> genotype and risk of HSR in patients with previous asymptomatic abacavir use is less clear.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations for Incidental Findings</strong></p>
<p>Although other variants in <em>HLA-B</em> are associated with autoimmune diseases and drug response phenotypes, they have not been associated with abacavir HSR.</p>
<p><strong>Other Considerations</strong></p>
<p>Abacavir skin patch testing may be performed after a case of clinically diagnosed HSR to determine whether it can be immunologically confirmed. At this time, skin patch testing is an investigational procedure, and the results should be interpreted only by an experienced immunologist. More details on skin patch testing can be found in the Supplementary Materials and Methods online (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>

<p>To construct a <em>human leukocyte antigen B (HLA-B)*57:01</em> minor allele frequency table based on ethnicity, the PubMed&amp;reg; database (1966 to April 2011) and Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to April 2011) were searched using the following criteria: ((HLA-B OR HLA-B57 OR HLA-B*5701) AND (genotype OR allele OR frequency)) with filter limits set to retrieve &quot;full-text&quot; and &quot;English&quot; literature. Studies were considered for inclusion if (1) the ethnicity of the population was clearly indicated; (2) either allele frequencies or alleles for <em>HLA-B*57:01</em> genotypes were reported; (3) the method by which <em>HLA-B</em> was genotyped was reliable and proven (no proof-of-principle experiments); (4) the sample population consisted of at least 50 individuals; (5) the study represented publication of novel data (no reviews or meta-analyses) and (6) the population studied did not have any concomitant disease (such as autoimmune conditions) that would be expected to result in a distribution of <em>HLA-B</em> alleles that were different from the general population. In instances where genotype data from large cohorts of ethnically diverse individuals were reported, without respect to ethnicity, studies were only considered if one ethnicity was &amp;ge;95% of the majority. Additional studies were also included from the Allele Frequency Net Database (<a href=&quot;http://www.allelefrequencies.net&quot; title=&quot;Allele Frequency Net Database&quot;>www.allelefrequencies.net</a>), an online repository for HLA allele frequencies from both previously published and unpublished sources, if they met the previously described inclusion criteria. All previously published data were manually checked against the original publications to verify the <em>HLA-B*57:01</em> allele frequencies. In some cases, sample sizes or allele frequencies were updated to reflect only subjects successfully genotyped for <em>HLA-B*57:01</em> (rather than the total sample size of the study) or to correct errata in the original publication. The combined analysis included 35,630 Europeans, 1,321 South Americans, 8,570 Africans, 1,029 Middle Easterners, 3,391 Mexicans, 12,175 Asians, and 326 Southwest Asians.</p>

<p>The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium's dosing recommendations are based weighing the evidence from a combination of preclinical functional and clinical data, as well as on some existing disease-specific consensus guidelines. Some of the factors that are taken into account include in vitro cytokine profiling of abacavir-stimulated immune cells in patients with various <em>human leukocyte antigen B&amp;nbsp;(HLA-B)</em> alleles, as well as both retrospective and prospective in vivo clinical outcome data for abacavir. Overall, the dosing recommendations are simplified to allow rapid interpretation by clinicians.

<p>While the guideline authors found no new evidence that would change their original recommendations, they did find one additional study that was added to the evidence table in the supplementary material (see Supplementary Table S3 in the online Supplemental material [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]).

Importantly, a number of effective and safe antiretrovirals are available that can be substituted for abacavir in patients carrying this risk-related allele. <em>HLA-B*57:01</em>'s high negative predictive value (&amp;gt;99%) shows that it is extremely effective in identifying those at risk of immunologically confirmed hypersensitivity to abacavir.</p></div>"/>

    <li>A potential problem of <em>human leukocyte antigen B&amp;nbsp;(HLA-B)*57:01</em> testing would be an error in genotyping or in reporting a genotype. This could result in high-risk patients mistakenly being given abacavir and potentially having a hypersensitivity reaction (HSR). However, given that patients testing negative for <em>HLA-B*57:01</em> also have a 3% risk of developing a clinically diagnosed hypersensitivity reaction (HSR), standard practice would include patient counseling and careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of an HSR. </li>
    <li>Given the lifelong nature of genotype results, an error in genotyping may also have a broader adverse impact on a patient's health care if other associations with <em>HLA-B*57:01</em> are found in the future. </li>

<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The positive predictive value of <em>human leukocyte antigen B&amp;nbsp;(HLA-B)*57:01</em> genotyping is ~50%, which means that a significant number of patients will be denied abacavir on the basis of their genotyping results even though they would have been able to take abacavir without experiencing a hypersensitivity reaction (HSR). There is currently no way to know <em>a priori</em> which <em>HLA-B*57:01</em> carriers are and which are not likely to experience HSRs, although new genetic risk factors may be found in the future. Given the potential seriousness of HSRs, the moderate positive predictive value is greatly outweighed by the very high negative predictive value of <em>HLA-B*57:01</em> genotyping. </li>
    <li><em>HLA-B*57:01</em> is not predictive of any other adverse reactions a patient may experience while on abacavir treatment, nor does it predict whether abacavir will be effective in treating a patient's human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In addition, genotyping is not a replacement for appropriate patient education and clinical monitoring for the signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity. The development of signs and symptoms of an HSR warrants that serious consideration be given to discontinuing abacavir, regardless of the <em>HLA-B</em> genotyping results. </li>
