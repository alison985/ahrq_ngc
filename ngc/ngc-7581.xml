	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Study Inclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>The work group developed <em>a priori</em> article inclusion criteria for their review. These criteria are the &quot;rules of evidence&quot; and articles that do not meet them are, for the purposes of this guideline, not evidence.</p>
<p>To be included in the systematic reviews (and hence, in this guideline) an article had to be a report of a study that:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Evaluated a treatment for osteoarthritis of the glenohumeral joint </li>
    <li>Was a full report of a clinical study and was published in the peer reviewed literature </li>
    <li>Was an English language article published after 1965 </li>
    <li>Was not a cadaveric, animal, <em>in vitro</em>, or biomechanical study </li>
    <li>Was not a retrospective case series, medical records review, meeting abstract, unpublished study report, case report, historical article, editorial, letter, or commentary </li>
    <li>Was the most recent report of a study or the report with the largest number of enrolled patients in a study with multiple publications </li>
    <li>Enrolled &amp;ge;10 patients in each of its study groups </li>
    <li>Enrolled a patient population comprised of at least 80% of patients with osteoarthritis of the glenohumeral joint </li>
    <li>Reports qualified results </li>
    <li>Enrolled less than 20% of patients with: neurologic conditions, inflammatory arthropathy, avascular necrosis (AVN), rotator cuff arthropathy, infection </li>
    <li>Study follow up must be at least 2 years (any surgical intervention). This criteria applies to Recommendations 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 (see 'Major Recommendations' field) </li>
    <li>Must not be a revision shoulder arthroplasty </li>
</ul>
<p>When examining primary studies the work group analyzed the best available evidence. They first considered outcomes reported in randomized controlled trials. They then sequentially searched for outcomes reported in controlled trials, prospective comparative studies, and retrospective comparative studies. Finally, they searched for prospective case-series studies. Only outcomes of the highest level of available evidence are included. For example, if there are two Level II Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Pain measures that address the recommendation, Level III, IV, or V VAS pain measures will not be included.</p>
<p>They included patient-oriented outcomes. As the term implies, patient-oriented outcomes are outcomes that matter to the patient. They tell clinicians, directly and without the need for extrapolation, that a diagnostic, therapeutic, or preventative procedure helps patients live longer or live better. Examples of patient-oriented outcomes include pain, function, and quality of life.</p>
<p>The work group also excluded some outcomes from consideration. They did not include surrogate outcomes. Surrogate outcome measures are laboratory measurements or another physical sign used as substitutes for a clinically meaningful end point that measures directly how a patient feels, functions, or survives. For a surrogate outcome to be valid it must be in the causal pathway between intervention and the outcome and it must demonstrate a large, consistently measurable association with the outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Literature Searches</strong></p>
<p>The work group attempted to make the searches for articles comprehensive. Using comprehensive literature searches ensures that the evidence considered for this guideline is not biased for (or against) any particular point of view.</p>
<p>The work group searched for articles published from January 1966 to June 2009. Strategies for searching electronic databases were constructed by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Medical Librarian. The search strategies used are provided in Appendix III in the original guideline document. Six electronic databases were searched: PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, The National Guideline Clearinghouse and TRIP database.</p>
<p>All searches of electronic databases were supplemented with manual screening of bibliographies of all retrieved publications. The work group also searched the bibliographies of recent systematic reviews and other review articles for potentially relevant citations. Finally, a list of potentially relevant studies, not identified by the searches, was provided by the work group members. Medical management of osteoarthritis is covered by extensive literature; however, these studies were not limited to glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis.</p>
<p>The study attrition diagram (see Appendix IV in the original guideline document) provides details about the inclusion and exclusion of these studies.</p>
<p><strong>2014 Reaffirmation</strong></p>
<p>The 2009 guideline is based on a systematic review of published studies on the treatment of osteoarthritis of the glenohumeral joint in adults.</p>
<p>To reaffirm currency the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases were searched using the following search terms: &quot;glenohumeral arthritis&quot;[tw] OR ((shoulder*[tiab] OR &quot;Shoulder Joint&quot;[mh] OR glenohumer*[tw]) AND (Osteoarthritis[mh:noexp] OR osteoarthriti*[tiab] OR Arthritis[mh:noexp] OR (arthriti*[tiab] AND (degenerat*[tiab] OR erosion[tiab] OR eroded[tiab])) OR &quot;Arthroplasty, Replacement&quot;[mh:noexp] OR arthroplasty[tiab] OR &quot;Joint Prosthesis&quot;[mh:noexp] OR &quot;Prostheses and Implants&quot;[mh:noexp] OR resurfac*[tiab] OR hemiarthroplasty[tiab])) NOT ((&quot;Shoulder Fractures&quot;[majr] OR &quot;Rotator Cuff/injuries&quot;[majr] OR fractur*[ti] OR injur*[ti]) NOT (arthrit*[tw] OR osteoarthriti*[tw] OR periprosthetic[tiab] OR &quot;Prosthesis Failure&quot;[mh] OR &quot;Postoperative Complications&quot;[mh])). The date range for all searches was 12/08/2008 to 11/07/2013 and the searches were performed on 11/07/2013.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Data Extraction</strong></p>
<p>Data elements extracted from studies were defined in consultation with the physician work group. Three analysts completed data extraction independently for all studies. The work group audited the evidence tables. Disagreements about the accuracy of extracted data were resolved by consensus and consulting the work group. The elements extracted are shown in Appendix V in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Guidelines Unit constructed evidence tables to summarize the best evidence pertaining to each preliminary recommendation. These tables are available as a supplemental document available on the AAOS website (<a href=&quot;http://www.aaos.org/research/research.asp&quot; title=&quot;AAOS Web site&quot;>http://www.aaos.org/research/research.asp</a>). These evidence tables include complete lists of included and excluded articles, quality and design parameters of the included studies, and raw data extracted from the included studies.</p>
<p><strong>Judging the Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The work group assessed the quality of the evidence for each outcome at each time point reported in a study. They did not simply assess the overall quality of a study. This approach follows the recommendations of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) working group as well as others.</p>
<p>The work group evaluated quality on a per outcome basis rather than a per study basis because quality is not necessarily the same for all outcomes and all follow-up times reported in a study. For example, a study might report results immediately after patients received a given treatment and after some period of time has passed. Often, nearly all enrolled patients contribute data at early follow-up times but, at much later follow-up times, only a few patients may contribute data. One has more confidence in the earlier data than in the later data. The fact that the work group would assign a higher quality score to the earlier results reflects this difference in confidence.</p>
<p>The work group assessed the quality using a two step process. First, they assigned a Level of Evidence to all results reported in a study based solely on that study's design. Accordingly, all data presented in randomized controlled trials were initially categorized as Level I evidence, all results presented in non-randomized controlled trials and other prospective comparative studies were initially categorized as Level II, all results presented in retrospective comparative and case-control studies were initially categorized as Level III, and all results presented in case-series reports were initially categorized as Level IV (see Appendix VI in the original guideline document). The work group next assessed each outcome at each reported time point using a quality questionnaire and, when quality standards were not met, downgraded the Level of evidence (for this outcome at this time point) by one Level (see Appendix VI of the original guideline document).</p>
<p>Assigning a Level of Evidence on the basis of study design plus other quality characteristics ties the Levels of Evidence reported more closely to quality than Levels of Evidence based only on study design. Because the work group ties quality to Levels of Evidence, they are able to characterize the confidence one can have in their results. Accordingly, they characterize the confidence one can have in Level I evidence as high, the confidence one can have in Level II and III evidence as moderate, and the confidence one can have in Level IV and V evidence as low.</p>
<p><strong>Statistical Methods</strong></p>
<p>When possible the work group reports the results of the statistical analyses conducted by the authors of the included studies. In some circumstances, statistical testing was not conducted; however, the authors reported sufficient quantitative data, including measures of dispersion or patient level data for statistical testing. In these circumstances the work group used the statistical program STATA (StatCorp LP, College Station, Texas) to conduct their own analysis to interpret the results of a study. P-values &amp;lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant. When a statistical analysis was conducted,&amp;nbsp;they noted if the analysis was that of the study authors or their own.</p>
<p>STATA was also used to determine 95% confidence intervals, using the method of Wilson, when authors of the included studies reported counts or proportions. The program was also used to determine the magnitude of the treatment effect. For data reported as means (and associated measures of dispersion) the work group calculated a standardized mean difference by the method of Hedges and Olkin. For proportions, the work group calculated the odds ratio as a measure of treatment effect.</p>
<p>G*Power 3 (Franz Faul, Universitat Kiel, Germany) was used to determine if a study was sufficiently powered to detect the minimal clinically important improvement (MCII). In power calculations, the work group used 80% power, 95% confidence intervals, and the number of patients per group. This allowed calculation of the minimal detectable effect size which was compared to the MCII effect size to determine if the study had enough power to detect the MCII.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>An American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Glenohumeral Osteoarthritis Physician Work Group prepared this guideline and the underlying systematic reviews with the assistance of the AAOS Clinical Practice Guidelines Unit (see Appendix I in the original guideline document) in the Department of Research and Scientific Affairs at the AAOS.</p>
<p>To develop the guideline, the work group met at an introductory meeting on November 22, 2008 to establish the scope of the guideline. Upon completion of the systematic review, the work group met again on June 27 and 28, 2009 to write and vote on the final recommendations and rationales for each recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Formulating Preliminary Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The work group began work on this guideline by constructing a set of preliminary recommendations. These recommendations specify [what] should be done in [whom], [when], [where], and [how often or how long]. They function as questions for the systematic review, not as final recommendations or conclusions. Preliminary recommendations are almost always modified on the basis of the results of the systematic review. Once established, these <em>a priori</em> preliminary recommendations cannot be modified until the final work group meeting, they must be addressed by the systematic review, and the relevant review results must be presented in the final guideline.</p>
<p><strong>Defining the Strength of the Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>AAOS staff first assigned a preliminary strength rating for each recommendation that took only the quality and quantity of the available evidence into account (see &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field). Work group members then modified the preliminary strength rating using the 'Form for Assigning Grade of Recommendation (Interventions)' shown in Appendix VII of the original guideline document. This form is based on recommendations of the GRADE Work Group and requires the work group to consider the harms, benefits, and critical outcomes associated with a treatment. It also requires the work group to evaluate the applicability of the evidence. The final strength of the recommendation is assigned by the physician work group, which modifies the preliminary grade on the basis of these considerations.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus Development</strong></p>
<p>Work group members voted on each recommendation and its strength using a structured voting technique that was a modification of the Nominal Group Technique (see Appendix VIII in the original guideline document), a method previously used in guideline development. Voting on guideline recommendations was conducted by secret ballot. Briefly each member of the guideline work group ranks his or her agreement with a guideline recommendation or performance measure on a scale ranging from 1 to 9 (where 1 is &quot;extremely inappropriate&quot; and 9 is &quot;extremely appropriate&quot;). Consensus is obtained if the number of individuals who do not rate a measure as 7, 8, or 9 is statistically non-significant (as determined using the binomial distribution). Because the number of work group members who are allowed to dissent with the recommendation depends on statistical significance, the number of permissible dissenters varies with the size of the work group. If disagreements were not resolved after three voting rounds, no recommendation was adopted. Lack of agreement can be a reason that the strength of some recommendations may be labeled as &quot;Inconclusive.&quot;</p>
<p>For this guideline, the work group resolved all disagreements within three voting rounds and no recommendations were graded as &quot;inconclusive&quot; because of lack of agreement within the work group. Two consensus based recommendations were issued following the rules outlined in Appendix VIII in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>2014 Reaffirmation</strong></p>
<p>After review of the updated 2008-2013 literature, the AAOS determined that no changes were required.</p></div>"/>

<p>The draft of the guideline and evidence report were peer reviewed by outside specialty organizations that were nominated by the physician work group prior to the development of the guideline. Peer review was accomplished using a structured peer review form (see Appendix IX in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>In addition, the physician members of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Guidelines and Technology Oversight Committee, the Evidence Based Practice Committee and the Chairpersons of the AAOS Occupational Health and Workers' Compensation Committee and the Medical Liability Committee were given the opportunity to provide peer review of the draft document.</p>
<p>The work group forwarded the draft guideline to a total of 34 peer reviewers and 17 returned reviews. The disposition of all non-editorial peer review comments was documented and the guideline was modified in response to peer review. The peer reviews and the responses to them accompanied this guideline through the process of public commentary and the subsequent approval process. Peer reviewing organizations and peer reviewing individuals are listed in this document if they explicitly agree to allow them to publish this information (see Appendix X in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>Public Commentary</strong></p>
<p>After modifying the draft in response to peer review, the guideline was submitted for a thirty-day period of &quot;Public Commentary.&quot; Commentators consist of members of the AAOS Board of Directors (BOD), members of the Council on Research, Quality Assessment, and Technology (CORQAT), members of the Board of Councilors (BOC), and members of the Board of Specialty Societies (BOS). Based on these bodies, up to 185 commentators had the opportunity to provide input into the development of this guideline. Of these, one member returned public comments.</p>
<p><strong>The AAOS Guideline Approval Process</strong></p>
<p>In response to the non-editorial comments submitted during the period of public commentary, the draft was again modified by the AAOS Clinical Practice Guidelines Unit and physician work group members. The AAOS Guidelines and Technology Oversight Committee, the AAOS Evidence-based Practice Committee, the AAOS Council on Research, Quality Assessment, and Technology, and the AAOS Board of Directors approved the final guideline draft. Descriptions of these bodies are provided in Appendix II in the original guideline document.</p></div>"/>

This Clinical Practice Guideline is not intended to be a fixed protocol, as some patients may require more or less treatment or different means of diagnosis. Clinical patients may not necessarily be the same as those found in a clinical trial. Patient care and treatment should always be based on a clinician's independent medical judgment, given the individual patient's clinical circumstances. </li>
    <li>Some drugs or medical devices referenced or described in this Clinical Practice Guideline may not have been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or may have been cleared for a specific use only.
