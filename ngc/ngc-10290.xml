	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions of the levels of the recommendations (<strong>A, B, C</strong>) and classification of the evidence (<strong>Class I-IV</strong>) are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Identification of Patients with Occult Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation (NVAF)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Context</strong></p>
<p>In patients with recent cryptogenic stroke, outpatient cardiac rhythm monitoring performed with nonimplanted devices probably detects unsuspected NVAF at a rate that ranges from 0% to 23% (weighted average 10.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 7.9% to 14.3%]), with longer monitoring periods probably associated with a greater yield. Many of the NVAF episodes that are detected are clinically asymptomatic, and thus monitoring devices with continuous recording or automatic detection algorithms, rather than patient-triggered recording, are preferred. The risk of recurrent stroke is uncertain in patients with very brief (e.g., &amp;lt;30 seconds) or very infrequent episodes of NVAF; however, previous studies have demonstrated that NVAF tends to occur for progressively longer periods, and the stroke risk in patients with paroxysmal NVAF is similar to that in patients with persistent NVAF.</p>
<p><strong>Practice Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Clinicians might obtain outpatient cardiac rhythm studies in patients with cryptogenic stroke without known NVAF, to identify patients with occult NVAF (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Clinicians might obtain cardiac rhythm studies for prolonged periods (e.g., for 1 or more weeks) instead of shorter periods (e.g., 24 hours) in patients with cryptogenic stroke without known NVAF, to increase the yield of identification of patients with occult NVAF (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Selection of Patients for Antithrombotic Therapy</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Context</strong></p>
<p>Within the NVAF population, the absolute risk of ischemic stroke varies widely on the basis of the presence of other stroke risk factors. The absolute stroke risk is highest among patients with NVAF and a history of stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) (aggregated absolute risk about 10%/y). Although multiple risk stratification tools are available for estimating the absolute stroke risk of patients with NVAF, the absolute stroke risks estimated by these tools vary widely.</p>
<p>Because it is difficult to determine with precision the absolute stroke risk in patients with NVAF, determining when the benefit from reduced stroke risk outweighs the harm of increased bleeding is likewise difficult. In these circumstances, patient preferences and physician judgment become especially important.</p>
<p><strong>Practice Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Clinicians should inform patients with NVAF that these patients have an increased stroke risk and that this risk can potentially be reduced by antithrombotic use. Patients should also be informed that antithrombotic use increases their risk of major bleeding (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Clinicians should counsel all patients with NVAF that the decision to use antithrombotics must be made only after the potential benefit from the stroke risk reduction has been weighed against the potential harm from the increased risk of major bleeding. Clinicians should also emphasize the important role of judgment and preferences in this decision (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Clinicians should routinely offer anticoagulation to patients with NVAF and a history of TIA or stroke, to reduce these patients' subsequent risk of ischemic stroke (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Clinicians might not offer anticoagulation to patients with NVAF who lack additional risk factors (&quot;lone&quot; NVAF patients). Clinicians might reasonably offer antithrombotic therapy with aspirin to such patients or might not offer antithrombotic therapy at all (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>To inform their judgments as to which patients with NVAF might benefit more from anticoagulation, clinicians should use a risk stratification scheme to help identify patients with NVAF who are at higher risk for stroke or at no clinically significant risk. However, clinicians should not rigidly interpret anticoagulation thresholds suggested by these tools as being definitive indicators of which patients require anticoagulation (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Selection of a Specific Oral Anticoagulant</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Context</strong></p>
<p>The guideline panel's review indicates that several anticoagulant medications decrease the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with NVAF. In clinical trials, the new oral anticoagulants are noninferior or superior to warfarin for reducing stroke, and in most patients the reduction in ischemic stroke risk outweighs the risk of bleeding complications.</p>
<p><strong>Practice Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>To reduce the risk of stroke or subsequent stroke in patients with NVAF judged to require oral anticoagulants, clinicians should choose one of the following options (<strong>Level B</strong>):
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Warfarin, target international normalized ratio (INR) 2.0 to 3.0 </li>
        <li>Dabigatran 150 mg twice daily (if creatinine clearance [CrCl] &amp;gt;30 mL/min) </li>
        <li>Rivaroxaban 15 mg/d (if CrCl 30 to 49 mL/ min) or 20 mg/d </li>
        <li>Apixaban 5 mg twice daily (if serum creatinine &amp;lt;1.5 mg/dL) or 2.5 mg twice daily if <em>any 2</em> of the following criteria are present: serum creatinine &amp;gt;1.5 mg/dL and &amp;lt;2.5 mg/dL; body weight &amp;le;60 kg; age &amp;ge;80 years.) </li>
        <li>Triflusal 600 mg plus acenocoumarol, target INR 1.25 to 2.0 (patients at moderate stroke risk, mostly in developing countries) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Patients Already Taking Warfarin</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;2&quot;>
    <li>Clinicians might recommend that patients taking warfarin whose condition is well-controlled continue warfarin treatment rather than switch to treatment with a new oral anticoagulant (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Intracranial Bleeding Risk</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;3&quot;>
    <li>Clinicians should administer dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban to patients who have NVAF requiring anticoagulant medication and are at higher risk of intracranial bleeding (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Gastrointestinal (GI) Bleeding Risk</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;4&quot;>
    <li>Clinicians might offer apixaban to patients with NVAF and GI bleeding risk who require anticoagulant medication (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Other Factors Affecting Administration of New Oral Anticoagulants</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;5&quot;>
    <li>Clinicians should offer dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban to patients unwilling or unable to submit to frequent periodic testing of INR levels (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Clinicians should offer apixaban to patients unsuitable for being treated, or unwilling to be treated, with warfarin (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Where apixaban is unavailable, clinicians might offer dabigatran or rivaroxaban (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Where oral anticoagulants are unavailable, clinicians might offer a combination of aspirin and clopidogrel (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Where triflusal is available and patients are unable or unwilling to take new oral anticoagulants (mostly in developing countries), clinicians should offer acenocoumarol (target INR 1.25 to 2.0) and triflusal to patients with NVAF who are at moderate stroke risk and higher bleeding risk (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Special Populations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Context</strong></p>
<p>Some clinicians are reluctant to use anticoagulants to treat elderly patients with NVAF because of perceived high risk of bleeding. However, anticoagulation with warfarin is superior to that with aspirin for reducing the risk of ischemic stroke in patients &amp;ge;75 years with NVAF, whereas rates of major bleeding are comparable. In one important subgroup, elderly patients who have frequent falls or advanced dementia, data are insufficient to determine whether anticoagulants are safe or effective. One study that used a decision analysis model estimated that an elderly patient would need to fall 295 times in 1 year to offset the stroke reduction benefits with warfarin.</p>
<p>Another important subgroup is patients with renal failure. For dabigatran, one of the newer anticoagulants, a lower dose of 75 mg bid is recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration when the CrCl reaches 15 to 30 mL/min. Apixaban is recommended at 5 mg twice daily, if serum creatinine is &amp;lt;1.5 mg/dL, or at 2.5 mg twice daily, if serum creatinine is &amp;gt;1.5 and &amp;lt;2.5 mg/dL. Rivaroxaban was tested in patients at 15 mg daily, if CrCl is 30 to 49 mL/min, or at 20 mg daily, if CrCl is &amp;gt;50 mL/min, and recommendations are limited to these patient groups. With regard to warfarin, data have shown that warfarin treatment is associated with a decreased risk of stroke or systemic thromboembolism among patients with non&amp;ndash;end-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) but that warfarin treatment may be associated with an increased bleeding risk.</p>
<p><strong>Practice Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Clinicians should routinely offer oral anticoagulants to elderly patients (aged &amp;gt;75 years) with NVAF if there is no history of recent unprovoked bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Clinicians might offer oral anticoagulation to patients with NVAF who have dementia or occasional falls. However, clinicians should counsel patients or their families that the risk&amp;ndash;benefit ratio of oral anticoagulants is uncertain in patients with NVAF who have moderate to severe dementia or very frequent falls (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Because the risk&amp;ndash;benefit ratio of oral anticoagulants in patients with NVAF and end-stage renal disease is unknown, there is insufficient evidence for making practice recommendations (<strong>Level U</strong>). </li>

<p><strong>For Questions Related to Screening (Yield)</strong></p>
<p><em>Class I</em></p>
<p>A statistical,<sup>a</sup> population-based<sup>b</sup> sample of patients studied at a uniform point in time (usually early) during the course of the condition. All patients undergo the intervention of interest. The outcome, if not objective,<sup>c</sup> is determined in an evaluation that is masked to the patients' clinical presentations.</p>

<p>A statistical,<sup>b</sup> non&amp;ndash;referral-clinic-based<sup>d</sup> sample of patients studied at a uniform point in time (usually early) during the course of the condition. Most (&amp;gt;80%) patients undergo the intervention of interest. The outcome, if not objective,<sup>c</sup> is determined in an evaluation that is masked to the patients' clinical presentations.</p>
<p><em>Class III</em></p>
<p>A sample of patients studied during the course of the condition. Some patients undergo the intervention of interest. The outcome, if not objective,<sup>c</sup> is determined in an evaluation by someone other than the treating physician.</p>
<p><em>Class IV</em></p>
<p>The data are derived from expert opinion, case reports, or any study not meeting criteria for Class I to III.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>a</sup>Statistical sample: The study uses a complete (consecutive), random, or systematic (e.g., every third patient) sample of the available population with the disease.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>b</sup>Population based: The available population for the study consists of all patients within a defined geographic region.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>c</sup>Objective: The objective consists of an outcome measure that is very unlikely to be affected by an observer's expectations (e.g., determination of death, the presence of a mass on head computed tomography, serum B12 assays).</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>d</sup>Non&amp;ndash;referral-clinic based: The available population for the study consists of all patients presenting to a primary care setting with the condition. For referral-clinic-based studies, the available population consists of all patients referred to a tertiary care or specialty setting. These patients may have been selected for more severe or unusual forms of the condition and thus may be less representative.</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.*)</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an &quot;A&quot; recommendation if 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &amp;gt;5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &amp;gt;2).</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Assigning a Level of Strength to the Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>When there is sufficient evidence to support an inference for the use of an intervention (i.e., the balance of benefits and harms favors the intervention), the author panel assigns one of three recommendation designations: A, B, or C. Each designation corresponds to a helping verb that denotes the level of strength of the recommendation. <strong>Level A</strong> is the strongest recommendation level and is denoted by the use of the helping verb <em>must</em>. Must recommendations are rare, as they are based on high confidence in the evidence and require both a high magnitude of benefit and low risk. <strong>Level B</strong> corresponds to the helping verb <em>should</em>. <em>Should</em> recommendations tend to be more common, as the requirements are less stringent but still based on the evidence and benefit&amp;ndash;risk profile. Finally, <strong>Level C</strong> corresponds to the helping verb <em>may</em> or <em>might</em>. <em>May</em> and <em>might</em> recommendations represent the lowest allowable recommendation level the American Academy of Neurology (AAN considers useful within the scope of clinical practice and can accommodate the highest degree of practice variation.</p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> denotes a practice recommendation that &quot;must&quot; be done. In almost all circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will improve health-related outcomes. A <strong>Level B</strong> indicates a recommendation that &quot;should&quot; be done. In most circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will likely improve health-related outcomes. A <strong>Level C</strong> represents a recommendation that &quot;might&quot; be done. In some circumstances, adherence to the recommendation might improve health-related outcomes. </p>
<p>When there is insufficient evidence to support an inference for the use of an intervention (i.e., the balance of benefits and harms is unknown) a <strong>Level U</strong> or <strong>Level R</strong> designation is appropriate.</p>
<p>A <strong>Level U</strong> indicates that the available evidence is insufficient to support or refute the efficacy of an intervention. A <strong>Level R</strong> is assigned when the balance of benefits and harms is unknown and the intervention is known to be expensive or have important risks. A <strong>Level R</strong> designates that the intervention should not be used outside of a research setting. Non&amp;ndash;evidence-based factors that need to be transparently and systematically considered when formulating recommendations include the following:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The relative value of the benefit as compared with the risk; this is derived from consideration of:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>The importance to patients of the health related-outcomes (both benefits and harms) </li>
        <li>The size of the intervention's effect </li>
        <li>The risk of harm of the intervention (i.e., tolerability and safety)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The feasibility of complying with the intervention (e.g., the intervention's availability) </li>
    <li>The cost of the intervention </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Conflict of Interest</strong></p>
<p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is committed to producing independent, critical and truthful clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Significant efforts are made to minimize the potential for conflicts of interest to influence the recommendations of this CPG. To the extent possible, the AAN keeps separate those who have a financial stake in the success or failure of the products appraised in the CPGs and the developers of the guidelines. Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee prior to project initiation. AAN limits the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest. The AAN forbids commercial participation in, or funding of, guideline projects.
