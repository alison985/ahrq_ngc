	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions of the strength of the empirical and/or clinical support ratings (<strong>CS, CG, OP, NE</strong>) are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 1. Psychiatric assessments for children and adolescents should include screening questions for psychosis. [CS]</strong></p>
<p>In the psychiatric assessment, general inquiries should be made regarding changes in behavior or any evidence of problems with thinking or perceptions. Questions such as &quot;Does your mind ever play tricks on you?,&quot; &quot;Do you hear voices talking to you when no one is there?,&quot; and &quot;Does your mind ever feel confused&quot; help elicit possible symptoms. Youth with early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) can generally describe relevant aspects of their psychotic symptoms, although some will be too disorganized, confused, and/or paranoid to provide accurate details or relevant history. Parents, family members, teachers, and treatment providers are important sources of information for documenting overt changes in behavior and thinking.</p>
<p>It is important to gauge suspected psychosis in a developmental context. When evaluating youth, especially children younger than 12 years, the clinician must ensure that the child understands the question and that developmental considerations are taken into account. True psychotic symptoms are generally confusing to the individual and experienced as distressing external phenomena beyond the individual's control. Highly descriptive, detailed, organized, and/or situation-specific reports are less likely to represent true psychosis. Schizophrenia and other psychotic illnesses are associated with disorganized thinking and behavior and deterioration in functioning. Overt signs of the illness should be evident on the mental status examination and in descriptions of the child's behavior. Without overt evidence of psychosis, the validity of symptom reports suggestive of schizophrenia in children needs to be carefully scrutinized.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2. The diagnosis of schizophrenia in children and adolescents should follow the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)</em> criteria, using the same criteria as for adults. [CS]</strong></p>
<p>A comprehensive diagnostic assessment includes interviews with the child or adolescent and the family plus a review of past records and any other available ancillary information. Issues to address include overt evidence of psychotic symptoms (including mental status examination findings, symptom presentation, course of illness) and a pertinent review of systems and potential confounding factors (including any history of significant developmental problems, mood disorders, trauma, or substance abuse).</p>
<p>Diagnostic accuracy may be improved by using a structured diagnostic interview that is designed for youth and includes a module for psychotic illnesses. Diagnostic status should be reassessed over time because clinical presentations of psychotic illnesses tend to change, especially during the first few years of illness. In some cases, decreasing a child's medication burden (including attempting a medication-free trial if possible) may be indicated to clarify a complicated clinical presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 3. Youth with suspected schizophrenia should be carefully evaluated for other pertinent clinical conditions and/or associated problems, including suicidality, comorbid disorders, substance abuse, developmental disabilities, psychosocial stressors, and medical problems. [CS]</strong></p>
<p>Youth with suspected schizophrenia require a thorough psychiatric and medical evaluation, including the assessment for common comorbid conditions, such as substance abuse or cognitive delays. When present, active psychotic symptoms are generally prioritized as the main target for treatment. Comorbid conditions, such as substance abuse, may respond better to treatment once acute symptoms of schizophrenia are stabilized. However, any life-threatening symptoms, such as suicidal behavior or severe aggressive behaviors, must be prioritized in the treatment plan.</p>
<p>There are no neuroimaging, psychological, or laboratory tests that establish a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The medical evaluation focuses on ruling out nonpsychiatric causes of psychosis and establishing baseline laboratory parameters for monitoring medication therapy. More extensive evaluation is indicated for atypical presentations, such as a gross deterioration in cognitive and motor abilities, focal neurologic symptoms, or delirium.</p>
<p>Assessments are obtained based on specific medical indications, e.g., neuroimaging studies when neurologic symptoms are present or an electroencephalogram for a clinical history suggestive of seizures. Toxicology screens are indicated for acute onset or exacerbations of psychosis when exposure to drugs of abuse cannot otherwise be ruled out. Genetic testing is indicated if there are associated dysmorphic or syndromic features. Similarly, tests to rule out specific syndromes or diseases (e.g., amino acid screens for inborn errors of metabolism, ceruloplasmin for Wilson disease, porphobilinogen for acute intermittent porphyria) are indicated for clinical presentations suggestive of the specific syndrome in question. Broad screening for rare medical conditions is not likely to be informative in individuals with psychosis who do not present with other neurologic or medical concerns.</p>
<p>At the time of first diagnosis, routine laboratory testing typically assesses blood counts, liver and renal functions, and metabolic parameters and thyroid functions, which provide a general medical screen and serve as baseline assessments for medication monitoring. Neuropsychological testing cannot be used to establish the diagnosis but may be important for documenting cognitive deficits and for treatment and academic planning.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 4. Antipsychotic medication is a primary treatment for schizophrenia spectrum disorders in children and adolescents. [CS]</strong></p>
<p>The efficacy of antipsychotic medications in the acute treatment of adults with schizophrenia is well established. In community settings, the atypical agents are often considered the preferred treatment. However, large adult trials, including the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness study, the Cost Utility of the Latest Antipsychotic Drugs in Schizophrenia study, and the European First-Episode Schizophrenia Trial study, raise questions as to whether second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics truly have superior efficacy than first-generation (typical) antipsychotics. Furthermore, many patients do not maintain the same medication treatment long term, often owing to lack of efficacy, side effects, or noncompliance.</p>
<p>Antipsychotic agents are also considered first-line treatment for schizophrenia spectrum disorders in youth, with second-generation agents typically being the treatments of first choice. It is recommended that these agents are used in conjunction with psychotherapeutic interventions (see Recommendation 9 below).</p>
<p>At this time, most atypical and traditional agents, with the exception of clozapine, can be used as primary treatment options for EOS. Risperidone, aripiprazole, quetiapine, paliperidone, and olanzapine are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating schizophrenia in adolescents 13 years and older. Haloperidol and molindone are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating schizophrenia in youth 13 years and older. However, the production of molindone was discontinued by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Safety and effectiveness data addressing the use of antipsychotic medications for EOS remain limited and for the most part reflect short-term use. Comparative trials are generally lacking. The choice of which agent to use first is typically based on Food and Drug Administration approval status, side effect profile, patient and family preferences, clinician familiarity, and cost. Individual responses to different antipsychotics are variable, and if insufficient effects are evident after a 6-week trial using adequate dosages, a different antipsychotic agent should be tried. The risk for weight gain with olanzapine may limit its use as a first-line agent. An industry-sponsored trial of ziprasidone for adolescents with schizophrenia was terminated prematurely in 2009 because of a lack of efficacy. Therefore, ziprasidone probably should not be considered for this population unless other data supporting efficacy become available.</p>
<p>Depot antipsychotics have not been studied in pediatric age groups and have inherent risks with long-term exposure to side effects. Therefore, they should be considered only in schizophrenic adolescents with documented chronic psychotic symptoms and a history of poor medication adherence.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 5. Ongoing medication therapy should be provided to most youth with schizophrenia to improve functioning and prevent relapse. [CS]</strong></p>
<p>Most individuals with schizophrenia need long-term treatment and are at significant risk of relapse if their antipsychotic medication is discontinued. Most youth with EOS remain chronically impaired, even with treatment. Patients should maintain regular physician contact to monitor symptom course, side effects, and adherence. The goal is to maintain the medication at the lowest effective dose to minimize potential adverse events. Many youth will continue to experience some degree of positive or negative symptoms, requiring ongoing treatment. The patient's overall medication burden should be reassessed over time, with the goal of maintaining effective dosages and minimizing side effects. Adjustments in medications should be gradual, with adequate monitoring for changes in symptom severity. After a prolonged remission, a small number of individuals may be able to discontinue antipsychotic medications without re-emergence of psychosis. In these situations, periodic longitudinal monitoring is still recommended because some of these patients may eventually experience another psychotic episode.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 6. Some youth with schizophrenia spectrum disorders may benefit from adjunctive medication treatments to address side effects of the antipsychotic agent or to alleviate associated symptomatology (e.g., agitation, mood instability, depression, explosive outbursts). [CG]</strong></p>
<p>Adjunctive medications commonly used in clinical practice include antiparkinsonian agents (extrapyramidal side effects), &amp;beta;-blockers (akathisia), mood stabilizers (mood instability, aggression), antidepressants (depression, negative symptoms), and/or benzodiazepines (anxiety, insomnia, akathisia). Benzodiazepines also are used as primary treatments for catatonia. There are no studies systematically addressing the use of adjunctive agents in youth with schizophrenia. Although adjunctive agents are widely used in adults with schizophrenia, further research is needed to establish their efficacy. Medication trials need to be conducted systematically to avoid unnecessary polypharmacy. Although youth with schizoaffective disorder are often assumed to need concurrent antidepressants or mood stabilizers, these practices have not been systematically studied.</p>
<p>The &amp;omega;-3 fatty acids have been suggested to be potentially useful as an adjunctive treatment for schizophrenia or as preventive therapy. One randomized controlled trial found that &amp;omega;-3 fatty acids helped delay the onset of psychosis in high-risk patients. As of yet, this study has not been replicated, and at this time there are no interventions with conclusive evidence for treating prodromal psychosis.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 7. A trial of clozapine should be considered for youth with treatment resistant schizophrenia spectrum disorders. [CS]</strong></p>
<p>Clozapine is the only antipsychotic agent for which there is established superiority over other agents. However, owing to potential side effects, clozapine is reserved for treatment refractory cases, i.e., patients with two or more failed trials of a first-line antipsychotic agent.</p>
<p>Before using clozapine, it is important to review the child's clinical status and treatment history to ensure that the presentation accurately reflects treatment refractory schizophrenia. For complicated cases or the apparent diagnosis of schizophrenia in a younger child (e.g., &amp;lt;12 years), a diagnostic second opinion may be warranted.</p>
<p>When using clozapine, systematic monitoring of side effects, including following established protocols for blood count monitoring, is required. White blood cell and absolute neutrophil counts are obtained at baseline and weekly for the first 6 months to monitor the risk for agranulocytosis. These protocols require a coordinated effort among the pharmacy, laboratory, and physician to ensure that the blood count parameters are being monitored concurrently with prescriptions.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 8. Baseline and follow-up monitoring of symptoms, side effects, and laboratory tests should be performed as indicated. [CS]</strong></p>
<p>Antipsychotic medications need to be monitored systematically for side effects (for specific recommendations, see the <a href=&quot;http://www.aacap.org/App_Themes/AACAP/docs/practice_parameters/Atypical_Antipsychotic_Medications_Web.pdf&quot; title=&quot;AACAP Web site&quot;>American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry [AACAP] Practice Parameter for the Use of Atypical Antipsychotic Medications in Children and Adolescents</a>). When using second-generation antipsychotic agents, it is particularly important to monitor metabolic functions and weight gain. Youth appear to be particularly prone to metabolic side effects, including the long-term risks of diabetes and hyperlipidemia.</p>
<p>Published data highlight the significant risk of weight gain with second-generation agents in children and adolescents and portend long-term risks for cardiovascular and metabolic problems. Thus, it is important that metabolic functions and risk factors are systematically monitored, including body mass index, fasting glucose, fasting triglycerides, fasting cholesterol, waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein/low-density lipoprotein, blood pressure, and symptoms of diabetes. Although the metabolic risks are widely recognized, most patients taking antipsychotic medications are not adequately monitored.</p>
<p>Consensus guidelines recommend the following:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>At baseline, assess the patient's and/or family history of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, or hypertension. </li>
    <li>Assess and document the patient's body mass index at baseline, at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, and at least every 3 months thereafter, or more often as indicated. </li>
    <li>Assess and document the patient's fasting glucose, fasting lipid profile, and blood pressure at baseline and after 3 months of treatment. If the results are normal after 3 months of treatment, glucose and blood pressure monitoring is recommended annually. If the lipid profile is normal after 3 months, follow-up monitoring is recommended at least every 5 years. </li>
</ul>
<p>These consensus guidelines were developed for all age groups. Recommendations for pediatric patients suggest following up on metabolic parameters every 6 months, with more frequent monitoring as clinically indicated.</p>
<p>All patients prescribed antipsychotic agents should be advised of the importance of a healthy lifestyle, including cessation of smoking, healthy diet, and routine exercise. If a patient develops significant weight gain or evidence of metabolic syndrome (obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance), the options include switching to a different antipsychotic agent with lower metabolic risk or adding an agent that targets metabolic problems (e.g., metformin). Clinically significant abnormalities (e.g., hypercholesterolemia) should be targeted for specific treatment and may require referral for specialty care.</p>
<p>Extrapyramidal side effects (EPSs), including dystonia, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, may occur with traditional or atypical agents and need to be periodically assessed throughout treatment. Standardized measurements, such as the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale and the Neurological Rating Scale, are helpful for monitoring for abnormal movements and neurologic side effects.</p>
<p>To avoid acute EPSs, the use of prophylactic antiparkinsonian agents may be considered, especially in those at risk for acute dystonias or have a history of dystonic reactions. The need for antiparkinsonian agents should be re-evaluated after the acute phase of treatment or if doses are lowered, because many patients do not need them during long-term therapy.</p>
<p>Other potential adverse events noted with antipsychotic agents include sedation, orthostatic hypotension, sexual dysfunction, hyperprolactinemia, electrocardiographic changes (including prolongation of the corrected QT interval), elevated liver transaminases, and steatohepatitis. In adults, traditional and atypical antipsychotic agents are associated with an increased risk of sudden death. Sudden death is very rare in pediatric populations. However, clinicians should be aware of the potential impact of these agents on cardiac functioning, including corrected QT interval prolongation, and monitor appropriately.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 9. Psychotherapeutic interventions should be provided in combination with medication therapies. [CG]</strong></p>
<p>In adults with schizophrenia, interventions found to be helpful include cognitive-behavioral therapies, social skills training, cognitive remediation, and family interventions. The goals of treatment include symptom reduction, improving social/occupational functioning, enhancing quality of life, and decreasing the risk for relapse. In addition, interventions addressing comorbid conditions, such as substance abuse, are important to lower the risk of relapse and improve quality of functioning.</p>
<p>Although further studies are needed, youth with EOS should benefit from adjunctive psychotherapies designed to remediate morbidity and promote treatment adherence. Strategies for the patient include psychoeducation regarding the illness and treatment options, social skills training, relapse prevention, basic life skills training, and problem-solving skills or strategies. Psychoeducation for the family is also indicated to increase their understanding of the illness, treatment options, and prognosis and to develop strategies to cope with the patient's symptoms. Some youth will need specialized educational programs and/or vocational training programs to address the cognitive and functional deficits associated with the illness.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 10. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be used with severely impaired adolescents if medications are not helpful or cannot be tolerated. [OP]</strong></p>
<p>Research evidence supports the use of ECT, typically in combination with antipsychotic therapy, as a treatment for schizophrenia in adults. ECT is generally used for patients who do not adequately respond to or cannot tolerate antipsychotic medications or those with catatonia. ECT has not been systematically studied in youth with EOS. The clinician must balance the relative risks and benefits of ECT against the morbidity of the disorder, the attitudes of the patient and family, and the availability of other treatment options. Obtaining informed consent from the parents, including a detailed discussion of the potential cognitive deficits, is necessary.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Earlier versions of this parameter were published in 1994 and 2001. The most recent literature search covered a 5-year period (January 2004 through August 2010) using PubMed, PsycINFO (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), and Web of Science databases. The initial searches were inclusive and sensitive for PubMed using a combination of MeSH headings and key words. The search was adjusted for CINAHL and PsycINFO by &quot;translating,&quot; where necessary, from the MeSH thesaurus to the CINAHL and PsycInfo thesauri, and using the same key words. The Web of Science search also was adjusted because this database responds only to key-word searching. </p>
<p>In PubMed, the search strategy from the Cochrane Review Group on schizophrenia was used (see below), yielding 282,328 results. This was refined to reflect treatment studies and reviews with limits for ages 0 to 18 years and English language applied, resulting in 3,662 articles. Search in CINAHL yielded an additional 55 articles, Web of Science 214 articles, and PsycINFO 24 articles. Once duplicates were removed, there were 3,186 articles.</p>
<p>The titles and abstracts of these articles were reviewed. Many studies identified in the search were conducted in a primarily adult population with only a few adolescent subjects. Articles with a focus on early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) treatment (87) were prioritized for inclusion. Additional selection criteria were based on the study's weight in the hierarchy of evidence (e.g., randomized controlled trials), attending to the quality of individual studies and the generalizability to clinical practice. The search was augmented by review of articles published before 2004, those nominated by expert review, those recently accepted for publication in peer-reviewed journals, and those pertaining to adult-onset schizophrenia treatment.</p>
