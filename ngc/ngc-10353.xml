<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Can Axillary Lymph Node Dissection (ALND) Be Avoided in Patients Who Have Tumor-Free (Negative) Sentinel Lymph Nodes (SLNs)?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1</em></p>
<p>Clinicians should not recommend ALND for women with early-stage breast cancer who do not have nodal metastases. Type: evidence based; benefits outweigh harms. Evidence quality: strong. Strength of recommendation: high.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Is ALND Necessary for All Patients with Metastatic Findings on Sentinel Node Biopsy (SNB)?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The recommendations in response to this clinical question were split into two separate recommendations. The first recommendation was crafted to reflect the eligibility criteria of Z0011 (women with early-stage breast cancer and one to two SLN metastases, who underwent breast-conserving surgery [BCS] with whole-breast radiotherapy).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 2.1: Is ALND Necessary for All Patients with Metastatic Findings on SNB Planning to Undergo BCS with Whole-Breast Radiotherapy?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.1</em></p>
<p>Clinicians should not recommend ALND for women with early-stage breast cancer and one or two SLN metastases who will undergo BCS with conventionally fractionated whole-breast radiotherapy. Type: evidence based; benefits outweigh harms. Evidence quality: strong. Strength of recommendation: high.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 2.2: Is ALND Necessary for All Patients with Metastatic Findings on SNB Who Are Planning to Undergo Mastectomy?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.2</em></p>
<p>Clinicians may offer ALND for women with early-stage breast cancer with nodal metastases found on SNB who will undergo mastectomy. Type: evidence based; benefits outweigh harms. Evidence quality: low. Strength of recommendation: weak.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What Is the Role of SNB in Special Circumstances in Clinical Practice?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Because of lack of evidence in many areas, the scope of this section was narrowed to the following circumstances. Recommendations from 2005 are available in Data Supplement 7 (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). These recommendations are limited by the insufficiency and paucity of data.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.1: Multicentric</em></p>
<p>Clinicians may offer SNB for women who have operable breast cancer and the following circumstance: multicentric tumors. Type: evidence based; benefits outweigh harms. Evidence quality: intermediate. Strength of recommendation: moderate.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.2: Ductal Carcinoma In Situ</em></p>
<p>Clinicians may offer SNB for women who have operable breast cancer and the following circumstance: ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), when mastectomy is performed. Type: informal consensus; benefits outweigh harms. Evidence quality: insufficient. Strength of recommendation: weak.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.3: Prior Surgery</em></p>
<p>Clinicians may offer SNB for women who have operable breast cancer and the following circumstance: prior breast and/or axillary surgery. Type: evidence based; benefits outweigh harms. Evidence quality: intermediate. Strength of recommendation: strong.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.4: Preoperative/Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy</em></p>
<p>Clinicians may offer SNB for women who have operable breast cancer and the following circumstance: preoperative/ neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NACT). Type: evidence based; benefits outweigh harms. Evidence quality: intermediate. Strength of recommendation: moderate.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Other Special Circumstances</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4.1: Large and Locally Advanced Invasive Tumors (T3/T4)</em></p>
<p>There are insufficient data to change the 2005 recommendation that clinicians should not perform SNB for women who have early-stage breast cancer and have the following circumstance: large or locally advanced invasive breast cancer (tumor size T3/T4). Type: informal consensus. Evidence quality: insufficient. Strength of recommendation: weak.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4.2</em></p>
<p>There are insufficient data to change the 2005 recommendation that clinicians should not perform SNB for women who have early-stage breast cancer and have the following circumstance: inflammatory breast cancer. Type: informal consensus. Evidence quality: insufficient. Strength of recommendation: weak.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4.3</em></p>
<p>There are insufficient data to change the 2005 recommendation that clinicians should not perform SNB for women who have early-stage breast cancer and the following circumstance: DCIS, when BCS is planned. Type: informal consensus. Evidence quality: insufficient. Strength of recommendation: strong.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4.4</em></p>
<p>There are insufficient data to change the 2005 recommendation that clinicians should not perform SNB for women who have early-stage breast cancer and have the following circumstance: pregnancy. Type: informal consensus. Evidence quality: insufficient. Strength of recommendation: weak.</p>

<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee convened an Update Committee with multidisciplinary representation in medical oncology, nuclear and radiation oncology, surgical oncology, pathology, community oncology, patient/advocacy representation, and guideline implementation. The Update Committee was led by two Co-Chairs who had primary responsibility for the development and timely completion of the guideline. For this guideline, the Co-chairs selected additional members from the Update Committee to form a Writing Group to assist in the development and review of the guideline drafts.</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Development Process</strong></p>
<p>The Update Committee met on several occasions and corresponded frequently through email; progress on guideline development was driven primarily by the Update Committee along with ASCO staff. The purpose of the Committee meetings was for members to contribute content, provide critical review, interpret evidence, and finalize the guideline recommendations based upon the consideration of the evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Development of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, using the <a href=&quot;http://medicine.yale.edu/cmi/glides/index.aspx&quot; title=&quot;GLIDES Web site&quot;>GuideLines Into DEcision Support (GLIDES)</a> methodology and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz&amp;trade; software. This method helps guideline panels systematically develop clear, translatable, and implementable recommendations using natural language, based on the evidence and assessment of its quality to increase usability for end users. The process incorporates distilling the actions involved, identifying who will carry them out, to whom, under what circumstances, and clarifying if and how end users can carry out the actions consistently. This process helps the Panel focus the discussion, avoid using unnecessary and/or ambiguous language and clearly state its intentions.</p></div>"/>

The information herein should not be relied on as being complete or accurate, nor should it be considered as inclusive of all proper treatments or methods of care or as a statement of the standard of care. With the rapid development of scientific knowledge, new evidence may emerge between the time information is developed and when it is published or read. The information is not continually updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence. The information addresses only the topics specifically identified therein and is not applicable to other interventions, diseases, or stages of diseases. This information does not mandate any particular course of medical care. Furthermore, the information is not intended to substitute for the independent professional judgment of the treating provider, because the information does not account for individual variation among patients. Recommendations reflect high, moderate, or low confidence that the recommendation reflects the net effect of a given course of action. The use of words like must, must not, should, and should not indicates that a course of action is recommended or not recommended for either most or many patients, but there is latitude for the treating physician to select other courses of action in individual cases. In all cases, the selected course of action should be considered by the treating provider in the context of treating the individual patient. Use of the information is voluntary.

    <li>Clinicians may perform sentinel node biopsy (SNB) for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) diagnosed by minimally invasive breast biopsy: one, when mastectomy is planned, because this precludes subsequent SNB at a second operation; two, when physical examination or imaging shows a mass lesion highly suggestive of invasive cancer; or three, the area of DCIS by imaging is large (&amp;ge;5 cm). SNB may be offered before or after neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NACT), but the procedure seems less accurate after NACT. This update deleted a recommendation for patients having undergone prior nononcologic breast surgery or axillary surgery because of insufficient data to inform a recommendation. </li>

    <field fieldid="131" ordby="1010" id="436" name="Description of Implementation Strategy" type="text">
      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed to be implemented in a variety of health settings. Barriers to implementation and application of the guideline recommendations include the need to increase awareness among front-line practitioners and cancer survivors and also the need to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network and other ASCO communications. ASCO guidelines are posted on the ASCO Web site and most often published in <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology</em> (JCO) and <em>Journal of Oncology Practice</em>.</p>
<p>Given the multidisciplinary care discussed in this guideline and the importance of sharing the update with the many relevant stakeholders, it is suggested that community oncologists, surgical oncologists, and radiation oncologists as well as patient navigators and academic, community, and hospital-based cancer centers consider these guidelines. In addition, given that the majority of US cancer programs have cancer tumor boards or continuing medical education activities that include the many clinicians treating breast cancer, the Panel encourages those programs to distribute and stimulate discussion of this guideline update. In expanding outreach of ASCO guidelines through the national tumor board system, the Panel hopes to speed the sharing of this update as well as to stimulate coordinated multidisciplinary care decisions among medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and surgical oncologists as well as patients, their advocates, and cancer program leaders. The American College of Surgeons, which accredits most U.S. cancer programs, has included review of National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer as quality measures in the past few years. Discussion of including ASCO guidelines and updates as part of this process would further increase the review and discussion of ASCO guidelines and likely speed the uptake of newly evaluated studies and guideline updates that can improve the quality of cancer care for patients.</p>
