	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: This guideline was developed by the Centre for Clinical Practice at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). See the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field for the full version of this guidance.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline (for example, words such as 'offer' and 'consider') denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendations). See the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field for further descriptions of the strength of recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Labelling of recommendations</strong>: New recommendations have been added about preventing falls in older people during a hospital stay. These are labeled <strong>[new 2013]</strong>. The original recommendations from NICE clinical guideline 21 are incorporated unchanged (except for minor wording changes for the purposes of clarification only). These are labeled <strong>[2004]</strong> or <strong>[2004, amended 2013]</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Preventing Falls in Older People</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Case/Risk Identification</strong></p>
<p>Older people in contact with healthcare professionals should be asked routinely whether they have fallen in the past year and asked about the frequency, context and characteristics of the fall/s. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>Older people reporting a fall or considered at risk of falling should be observed for balance and gait deficits and considered for their ability to benefit from interventions to improve strength and balance. (Tests of balance and gait commonly used in the United Kingdom [UK] are detailed in Section 3.3 of the full version of the original guideline.) <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Multifactorial Falls Risk Assessment</strong></p>
<p>Older people who present for medical attention because of a fall, or report recurrent falls in the past year, or demonstrate abnormalities of gait and/or balance should be offered a multifactorial falls risk assessment. This assessment should be performed by a healthcare professional with appropriate skills and experience, normally in the setting of a specialist falls service. This assessment should be part of an individualised, multifactorial intervention. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>Multifactorial assessment may include the following:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Identification of falls history </li>
    <li>Assessment of gait, balance and mobility, and muscle weakness </li>
    <li>Assessment of osteoporosis risk </li>
    <li>Assessment of the older person's perceived functional ability and fear relating to falling </li>
    <li>Assessment of visual impairment </li>
    <li>Assessment of cognitive impairment and neurological examination </li>
    <li>Assessment of urinary incontinence </li>
    <li>Assessment of home hazards </li>
    <li>Cardiovascular examination and medication review <strong>[2004]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Multifactorial Interventions</strong></p>
<p>All older people with recurrent falls or assessed as being at increased risk of falling should be considered for an individualised multifactorial intervention. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>In successful multifactorial intervention programmes the following specific components are common (against a background of the general diagnosis and management of causes and recognised risk factors):</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Strength and balance training </li>
    <li>Home hazard assessment and intervention </li>
    <li>Vision assessment and referral </li>
    <li>Medication review with modification/withdrawal <strong>[2004]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Following treatment for an injurious fall, older people should be offered a multidisciplinary assessment to identify and address future risk and individualised intervention aimed at promoting independence and improving physical and psychological function. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Strength and Balance Training</strong></p>
<p>Strength and balance training is recommended. Those most likely to benefit are older people living in the community with a history of recurrent falls and/or balance and gait deficit. A muscle-strengthening and balance programme should be offered. This should be individually prescribed and monitored by an appropriately trained professional. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Exercise in Extended Care Settings</strong></p>
<p>Multifactorial interventions with an exercise component are recommended for older people in extended care settings who are at risk of falling. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Home Hazard and Safety Intervention</strong></p>
<p>Older people who have received treatment in hospital following a fall should be offered a home hazard assessment and safety intervention/modifications by a suitably trained healthcare professional. Normally this should be part of discharge planning and be carried out within a timescale agreed by the patient or carer, and appropriate members of the health care team. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>Home hazard assessment is shown to be effective only in conjunction with follow-up and intervention, not in isolation. <strong>[2004] </strong></p>
<p><strong>Psychotropic Medications</strong></p>
<p>Older people on psychotropic medications should have their medication reviewed, with specialist input if appropriate, and discontinued if possible to reduce their risk of falling. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cardiac Pacing</strong></p>
<p>Cardiac pacing should be considered for older people with cardioinhibitory carotid sinus hypersensitivity who have experienced unexplained falls. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Encouraging the Participation of Older People in Falls Prevention Programmes</strong></p>
<p>To promote the participation of older people in falls prevention programmes the following should be considered.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Healthcare professionals involved in the assessment and prevention of falls should discuss what changes a person is willing to make to prevent falls. </li>
    <li>Information should be relevant and available in languages other than English. </li>
    <li>Falls prevention programmes should also address potential barriers such as low self-efficacy and fear of falling, and encourage activity change as negotiated with the participant. <strong>[2004]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Practitioners who are involved in developing falls prevention programmes should ensure that such programmes are flexible enough to accommodate participants' different needs and preferences and should promote the social value of such programmes. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Education and Information Giving</strong></p>
<p>All healthcare professionals dealing with patients known to be at risk of falling should develop and maintain basic professional competence in falls assessment and prevention. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>Individuals at risk of falling, and their carers, should be offered information orally and in writing about:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>What measures they can take to prevent further falls </li>
    <li>How to stay motivated if referred for falls prevention strategies that include exercise or strength and balancing components </li>
    <li>The preventable nature of some falls </li>
    <li>The physical and psychological benefits of modifying falls risk </li>
    <li>Where they can seek further advice and assistance </li>
    <li>How to cope if they have a fall, including how to summon help and how to avoid a long lie <strong>[2004]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interventions That Cannot Be Recommended</strong></p>
<p><em>Brisk walking</em>. There is no evidence<sup>1</sup> that brisk walking reduces the risk of falling. One trial showed that an unsupervised brisk walking programme increased the risk of falling in postmenopausal women with an upper limb fracture in the previous year. However, there may be other health benefits of brisk walking by older people. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Cannot Be Recommended Because of Insufficient Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The authors do not recommend implementation of the following interventions at present. This is not because there is strong evidence against them, but because there is insufficient or conflicting evidence supporting them<sup>1</sup>. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p><em>Low intensity exercise combined with incontinence programmes</em>. There is no evidence<sup>1</sup> that low intensity exercise interventions combined with continence promotion programmes reduce the incidence of falls in older people in extended care settings. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p><em>Group exercise (untargeted)</em>. Exercise in groups should not be discouraged as a means of health promotion, but there is little evidence<sup>1</sup> that exercise interventions that were not individually prescribed for older people living in the community are effective in falls prevention. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p><em>Cognitive/behavioural interventions</em>. There is no evidence<sup>1</sup> that cognitive/behavioural interventions alone reduce the incidence of falls in older people living in the community who are of unknown risk status. Such interventions included risk assessment with feedback and counselling and individual education discussions. There is no evidence<sup>1</sup> that complex interventions in which group activities included education, a behaviour modification programme aimed at moderating risk, advice and exercise interventions are effective in falls prevention with older people living in the community. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p><em>Referral for correction of visual impairment</em>. There is no evidence<sup>1</sup> that referral for correction of vision as a single intervention for older people living in the community is effective in reducing the number of people falling. However, vision assessment and referral has been a component of successful multifactorial falls prevention programmes. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p><em>Vitamin D</em>. There is evidence<sup>1</sup> that vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are common among older people and that, when present, they impair muscle strength and possibly neuromuscular function, via central nervous system (CNS)-mediated pathways. In addition, the use of combined calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation has been found to reduce fracture rates in older people in residential/nursing homes and sheltered accommodation. Although there is emerging evidence<sup>1</sup> that correction of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency may reduce the propensity for falling, there is uncertainty about the relative contribution to fracture reduction via this mechanism (as opposed to bone mass) and about the dose and route of administration required. No firm recommendation can therefore currently be made on its use for this indication.<sup>2</sup> <strong>[2004, amended 2013]</strong></p>
<p><em>Hip protectors</em>. Reported trials that have used individual patient randomisation have provided no evidence<sup>1</sup> for the effectiveness of hip protectors to prevent fractures when offered to older people living in extended care settings or in their own homes. Data from cluster randomised trials provide some evidence<sup>1</sup> that hip protectors are effective in the prevention of hip fractures in older people living in extended care settings who are considered at high risk.<strong> [2004]</strong></p>

<p>Do not use fall risk prediction tools to predict inpatients' risk of falling in hospital. <strong>[new 2013]</strong></p>
<p>Regard the following groups of inpatients as being at risk of falling in hospital and manage their care according to recommendations below:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>All patients aged 65 years or older </li>
    <li>Patients aged 50 to 64 years who are judged by a clinician to be at higher risk of falling because of an underlying condition. <strong>[new 2013]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assessment and Interventions</strong></p>
<p>Ensure that aspects of the inpatient environment (including flooring, lighting, furniture and fittings such as hand holds) that could affect patients' risk of falling are systematically identified and addressed. <strong>[new 2013]</strong></p>
<p>For patients at risk of falling in hospital (see recommendations above), consider a multifactorial assessment and a multifactorial intervention. <strong>[new 2013]</strong></p>
<p>Ensure that any multifactorial assessment identifies the patient's individual risk factors for falling in hospital that can be treated, improved or managed during their expected stay. These may include:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Cognitive impairment </li>
    <li>Continence problems </li>
    <li>Falls history, including causes and consequences (such as injury and fear of falling) </li>
    <li>Footwear that is unsuitable or missing </li>
    <li>Health problems that may increase their risk of falling </li>
    <li>Medication </li>
    <li>Postural instability, mobility problems and/or balance problems </li>
    <li>Syncope syndrome </li>
    <li>Visual impairment <strong>[new 2013]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Ensure that any multifactorial intervention:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Promptly addresses the patient's identified individual risk factors for falling in hospital <strong>and</strong> </li>
    <li>Takes into account whether the risk factors can be treated, improved or managed during the patient's expected stay. <strong>[new 2013]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Do not offer falls prevention interventions that are not tailored to address the patient's individual risk factors for falling. <strong>[new 2013]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information and Support</strong></p>
<p>Provide relevant oral and written information and support for patients, and their family members and carers if the patient agrees. Take into account the patient's ability to understand and retain information. Information should include:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Explaining about the patient's individual risk factors for falling in hospital </li>
    <li>Showing the patient how to use the nurse call system and encouraging them to use it when they need help </li>
    <li>Informing family members and carers about when and how to raise and lower bed rails </li>
    <li>Providing consistent messages about when a patient should ask for help before getting up or moving about </li>
    <li>Helping the patient to engage in any multifactorial intervention aimed at addressing their individual risk factors <strong>[new 2013]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Ensure that relevant information is shared across services. Apply the principles in <a href=&quot;http://publications.nice.org.uk/patient-experience-in-adult-nhs-services-improving-the-experience-of-care-for-people-using-adult-cg138/guidance#continuity-of-care-and-relationships&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;>Patient experience in adult NHS services (NICE clinical guideline 138)</a> in relation to continuity of care. <strong>[new 2013]</strong></p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>1</sup> This refers to evidence reviewed in 2004.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>2</sup> The following text has been deleted from the 2004 recommendation: &quot;Guidance on the use of vitamin D for fracture prevention will be contained in the forthcoming NICE clinical practice guideline on osteoporosis, which is currently under development.&quot; As yet there is no NICE guidance on the use of vitamin D for fracture prevention.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Some recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the GDG is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations labelled <strong>[new 2013]</strong> in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).</p>
<p>For all recommendations, NICE expects that there is discussion with the patient about the risks and benefits of the interventions, and their values and preferences. This discussion aims to help them to reach a fully informed decision (see also &quot;Patient-centred care&quot; in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Must (or Must Not) Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG usually uses &quot;must&quot; or &quot;must not&quot; only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally they use &quot;must&quot; (or &quot;must not&quot;) if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Should (or Should Not) Be Used &amp;ndash; A &quot;Strong&quot; Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses &quot;offer&quot; (and similar words such as &quot;refer&quot; or &quot;advise&quot;) when they are confident that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost effective. The GDG uses similar forms of words (for example, &quot;Do not offer&amp;hellip;&quot;) when they are confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Could Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses &quot;consider&quot; when they are confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost-effective, but other options may be similarly cost-effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.</p>
<p><strong>Wording of 2004 Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>NICE began using this approach to denote the strength of recommendations in guidelines that started development after publication of the 2009 version of &quot;The guidelines manual&quot; (January 2009). This does not apply to any recommendations ending <strong>[2004]</strong> (see the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field). In particular, for recommendations labelled<strong> [2004]</strong>, the word &quot;consider&quot; may not necessarily be used to denote the strength of the recommendation.</p></div>"/>

<p>This guideline is an extension to the remit of NICE clinical guideline 21 (published November 2004) to include assessing and preventing falls in older people during a hospital stay (inpatients).</p>
<p>The 2 main parts of the guideline are as follows:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Recommendations for all older people (Sections 1.1 and 3 of the full version of the guideline). Evidence on the assessment and prevention of falls in older people has not been updated and the original 2004 recommendations remain unchanged (except for some minor wording changes for the purposes of clarification only).

    <li>Additional recommendations for older people who are admitted to hospital (Sections 1.2 and 4 of the full version of the guideline).

<p><strong>Methods Used to Develop the Guideline</strong></p>
<p>The methods used to develop this guideline were different for the different sections, because of the evolution of guideline development methodology.</p>
<p>The section for all older people (section 3 of the full version of the guideline) comprises the previous 2004 guideline (CG21), which has been maintained as far as possible in its original structure and style (although it has been renumbered to maintain consistency throughout the entire guideline). The additional section for older people who are admitted to hospital (section 4 of the full version of the guideline) contains new evidence and recommendations that were developed using The guidelines manual (2009). This has inevitably led to inconsistencies in style. For example, Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology is used in section 4 to assess the quality and strength of the evidence and recommendations, whereas in section 3 the evidence and recommendations are graded using the old evidence hierarchy. In addition, in section 3 (developed in 2004) older people are defined as those aged 65 and older, but more recently the Department of Health has recognised that there are different interpretations of 'older people', some of which include people from the age of 50. Section 4 of the guideline reflects this, and the new recommendations also cover people aged between 50 and 64. The different sections of the guideline contain details of the methodology used at the time of development.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasise that although guideline methodology has changed over time, all of the 2004 recommendations are just as relevant and important now as they were when they were originally published.</p></div>"/>

<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>2013 Guideline Strength of Recommendations</strong></span></p>
<p>Some recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the GDG is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations labelled <strong>[new 2013]</strong> in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Must (or Must Not) Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG usually uses &quot;must&quot; or &quot;must not&quot; only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally they use &quot;must&quot; (or &quot;must not&quot;) if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Should (or Should Not) Be Used &amp;ndash; A &quot;Strong&quot; Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses &quot;offer&quot; (and similar words such as &quot;refer&quot; or &quot;advise&quot;) when they are confident that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost-effective. The GDG uses similar forms of words (for example, &quot;Do not offer&amp;hellip;&quot;) when they are confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Could Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses &quot;consider&quot; when they are confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost-effective, but other options may be similarly cost-effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.</p>
<p><strong>Wording of 2004 Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) began using this approach to denote the strength of recommendations in guidelines that started development after publication of the 2009 version of &quot;The guidelines manual&quot; (January 2009). This does not apply to any recommendations ending <strong>[2004]</strong> (see the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field). In particular, for recommendations labeled <strong>[2004]</strong>, the word &quot;consider&quot; may not necessarily be used to denote the strength of the recommendation.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>2004 Guideline Cost Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Cost-Effectiveness Review and Modelling: Methods and Results</strong></p>
<p>To fulfil the Department of Health (DH) and Welsh Assembly Government remit, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) requested that the cost-effectiveness evidence of interventions for the assessment and prevention of falls in older people be assessed. In accordance with the objectives of the scope, cost-effectiveness was addressed in the following way:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>A comparison of the cost and cost-effectiveness of falls prevention interventions compared with usual care, other intentions or no intervention </li>
    <li>An investigation of which types of falls prevention programmes are the most cost-effective. </li>
</ul>
<p>The aim of the review was twofold. Firstly, to identify economic evaluations that had been conducted alongside trials and secondly, to identify evidence that could be used in cost-effectiveness modelling.</p>
<p><strong>Summary of the Health Economics Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Although clinical and cost-effectiveness data exists for falls prevention, there are no UK studies. The quality of reporting in these studies is often patchy, as some costs and benefits are reported and not others. The reported studies did not use the same costing methods or always report incremental costs or discounting.</p>
<p>Those from countries other than the UK have limited applicability as the health care systems are often very different. Even in the small number of studies included, few comparisons can be made between studies due to the differences in methodology.</p>
<p>Identifying those individuals who may benefit most from an intervention is not always reported: who should be targeted for screening; when screening should take place; and at what intervals is an area of considerable uncertainty in terms of costs and benefits.</p>
<p>There is a lack of cost-effectiveness evidence in this area and therefore, the guideline development group (GDG) would recommend further research.</p>
<p><strong>The Cost-Effectiveness of Interventions to Prevent Falls in the Elderly: Modelling Report</strong></p>
<p>Cost-effectiveness analyses of two falls prevention strategies were reported; exercise programmes for at risk individuals dwelling in the community and multifactorial interventions for at risk individuals dwelling in the community.</p>
<p>The central estimates for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for both the multifactorial and exercise intervention indicate that both interventions are cost-effective, compared to doing nothing. However, these results most be interpreted with great caution. The bootstrapped confidence intervals around the ICERs are large, reflecting the great uncertainty surrounding the evidence for the effect, and indeed the costs of providing the interventions and the costs of treating fall related injuries.</p>
<p>For further results and discussion please refer to Section 3.4 of the full version of the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>2013 Guideline Cost Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Inpatient Falls Prevention Interventions: Health Economic Modeling</strong></p>
<p>In the absence of relevant published literature, an original health economic De novo model was constructed.</p>
<p><em>Decision Problem</em></p>
<p>The health economic analysis addressed one question from the guideline scope, based on GDG prioritisation:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>What is the cost-effectiveness of multifactorial interventions to reduce the risk and/or severity of inpatient falls for patients aged 65+, compared with usual care (assumed to be no actions to prevent falls)? </li>
</ul>
<p>The GDG recommended that single interventions should not be used to reduce the risk and/or severity of inpatient falls. Therefore, only multifactorial interventions were considered for health economic modelling.</p>
<p><em>Model Structure</em></p>
<p>The model used a discrete event (or individual patient) structure, capturing the costs and benefits associated with a series of events and discrete health states. A discrete event model was used to accurately model each patient's falls history, variable lifespan and differing time in each state (for more details, see Appendix K of the full version of the original guideline document.</p>
<p><em>Principal Findings</em></p>
<p>It would appear that, if inpatient falls can be prevented and/or their severity reduced, this is very likely to be a cost-effective course of action.</p>
<p>However, in both settings, the difference in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) is small, as can be seen in Figure 3 of the full version of the original guideline document. The changes represent less than 0.06% of lifetime QALYs in the model. The cost differences are slightly bigger, but still less than 0.7% of an average patient's total lifetime costs.</p>
<p>A difference of 0.003 QALYs or less (1 quality-adjusted day or less) may be viewed as clinically not relevant over an average lifetime of ten years. However, the average experience of the simulated cohort contains a great heterogeneity of experience, and some simulated patients will have derived very appreciable benefit from having falls averted during their hospitalisation(s). Certainly, the 25% reduction in fall rates (taken from the meta-analysis) was thought to be clinically significant by the GDG. Cost differences were small but generally indicated savings in both settings. Therefore, the intervention can probably be said to be cost-effective in the acute and non-acute settings, compared with no action to reduce the rate and/or severity of inpatient falls.</p>

    <li>This guidance represents the view of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which was arrived at after careful consideration of the evidence available. Healthcare professionals are expected to take it fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement. However, the guidance does not override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or guardian or carer, and informed by the summary of product characteristics of any drugs. </li>
    <li>Implementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local commissioners and/or providers. Commissioners and providers are reminded that it is their responsibility to implement the guidance, in their local context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations. Nothing in this guidance should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with compliance with those duties. </li>
    <li>Patients and healthcare professionals have rights and responsibilities as set out in the National Health Service (NHS) Constitution for England &amp;ndash; all NICE guidance is written to reflect these. Treatment and care should take into account individual needs and preferences. Patients should have the opportunity to make informed decisions about their care and treatment, in partnership with their healthcare professionals. Healthcare professionals should follow the Department of Health's advice on consent. If someone does not have the capacity to make decisions, healthcare professionals should follow the code of practice that accompanies the Mental Capacity Act and the supplementary code of practice on deprivation of liberty safeguards. In Wales, healthcare professionals should follow advice on consent from the Welsh Government. </li>
    <li>NICE has produced guidance on the components of good patient experience in adult NHS services. All healthcare professionals should follow the recommendations in Patient experience in adult NHS services. </li>
    <li>For all recommendations, NICE expects that there is discussion with the service user about the risks and benefits of the interventions, and their values and preferences. This discussion aims to help them to reach a fully informed decision (see also Patient-centred care). </li>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Key Priorities for Implementation</span></strong></p>
<p>The following recommendations have been identified as priorities for implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Preventing Falls in Older People</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Older people in contact with healthcare professionals should be asked routinely whether they have fallen in the past year and asked about the frequency, context and characteristics of the fall(s). <strong>[2004]</strong> </li>
    <li>Older people who present for medical attention because of a fall, or report recurrent falls in the past year, or demonstrate abnormalities of gait and/or balance should be offered a multifactorial falls risk assessment. This assessment should be performed by a healthcare professional with appropriate skills and experience, normally in the setting of a specialist falls service. This assessment should be part of an individualised, multifactorial intervention. <strong>[2004]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Preventing Falls in Older People during a Hospital Stay</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Regard the following groups of inpatients as being at risk of falling in hospital and manage their care according to recommendations for assessment and interventions:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>All patients aged 65 years or older </li>
        <li>Patients aged 50 to 64 years who are judged by a clinician to be at higher risk of falling because of an underlying condition <strong>[new 2013]</strong> </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>For patients at risk of falling in hospital, consider a multifactorial assessment and a multifactorial intervention. <strong>[new 2013]</strong> </li>
    <li>Ensure that any multifactorial assessment identifies the patient's individual risk factors for falling in hospital that can be treated, improved or managed during their expected stay. These may include:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Cognitive impairment </li>
        <li>Continence problems </li>
        <li>Falls history, including causes and consequences (such as injury and fear of falling) </li>
        <li>Footwear that is unsuitable or missing </li>
        <li>Health problems that may increase their risk of falling </li>
        <li>Medication </li>
        <li>Postural instability, mobility problems and/or balance problems </li>
        <li>Syncope syndrome </li>
        <li>Visual impairment <strong>[new 2013]</strong> </li>
