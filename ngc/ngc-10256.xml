      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Diagnosis and Pathologic Classification</strong></span></p>
<p>An excisional lymph node biopsy of the largest regionally involved lymph node is the optimal specimen for initial diagnostic assessment. Similarly, a sizable biopsy from the organ of origin in extranodal lymphomas is also suitable. Compelling clinical contraindications to an open biopsy should be present before considering any other options. A careful clinical examination or radiological investigations for more accessible or palpable pathologic adenopathy, and the results of a bone marrow staging biopsy could be useful in decision making prior to opting for a lesser diagnostic specimen. In general, fine needle aspirate biopsies and biopsies of secondarily involved tissue sites are regarded as suboptimal for the initial diagnosis of lymphoma. These latter specimens do provide excellent material for evaluating possible relapse, clarification of staging at questionable sites and as a source of additional specimen where required for further special testing or research. Occasionally, multiple needle core biopsies may supply adequate tissue but this needs to be assessed on a case by case basis. Whenever possible, a reference lymphoma pathologist should confirm the diagnosis; this is particularly important in cases when only a core needle biopsy is available.</p>
<p>Table 1 in the original guideline document describes the histologic subclassification of the malignant lymphomas, and is an adaptation of the most recent World Health Organization (WHO) classification. This classification is based on the light microscopic interpretation complemented by special stains, immunophenotyping, cytogenetics and other information as available. The specific lymphomas are divided into three major groups, according to the degree of clinical aggressiveness, for treatment planning. All B-cell lymphomas should be immuno-phenotyped to determine if they are CD20 positive.</p>
<p><strong>Required Immunohistochemical and FISH Testing for Lymphoma</strong></p>
<p>In general, guidelines for immunohistochemical and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing outlined in the most recent version of the WHO Classification of Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues should be followed so as to confirm a specific diagnosis and provide necessary prognostic and/or predictive information. In addition, the following are recommended by the Alberta Provincial Hematology Tumour Team:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma</strong>: The immunohistochemical panel may include CD45/CD3/CD20/CD30/CD15/PAX5/MUM1 and should be selected on a case by case basis at the discretion of the hematopathologist. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) studies by in situ hybridization (Epstein-Barr virus encoded ribonucleic acid [EBER]) may be considered if difficulty exists diagnostically, as most cases of the mixed-cellularity subtype of classical Hodgkin lymphoma are EBER positive. </li>
    <li><strong>Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)</strong>:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Immunohistochemical panels to distinguish between activated B-cell (ABC) type and germinal centre (GC) type have serious limitations (regardless of which algorithm is employed) and do not accurately subclassify many cases of DLBCL when compared to gene expression profiling. Therefore, routine use of immunohistochemical stains for the express purpose of subtyping ABC versus GC is not recommended. Relevant stains may be performed if considered of diagnostic importance by the reporting hematopathologist. </li>
        <li>EBER and CD5 expression confer worse prognosis. CD5 should be performed on all DLBCL patients, and EBER should be performed in patients with immune suppression related lymphomas, or those who possibly have EBV-related DLBCL the elderly. </li>
        <li><em>MYC</em> rearrangement by FISH, especially in association with <em>BCL2</em> and/or <em>BCL6</em> (double or triple hit disease) is associated with very poor outcomes following rituximab + cyclophosphamide + adriamycin + vincristine + prednisone (R-CHOP) therapy, as well as high rates of central nervous system relapse. Such patients under age 70 years should receive more aggressive therapy with a Burkitt lymphoma regimen and possibly stem cell transplantation. Though rare, it is very important to recognize this diagnosis, and therefore, <em>MYC</em> rearrangement testing by FISH is required. If <em>MYC</em> is rearranged, the case should be followed-up with <em>BCL2</em> and <em>BCL6</em> rearrangement testing by FISH. The preceding is true for all new diagnoses of DLBCL in patients under 70 years, but especially for patients with:
        <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
            <li>Atypical morphology (intermediate between DLBCL and Burkitt, usually with a GC cell of origin immunohistochemical [IHC] phenotype) </li>
            <li>High proliferation rate by Ki67 &amp;gt;80%, or </li>
            <li>DLBCL with aggressive clinical behaviour (as requested by hematologist/oncologist). </li>
        </ol>
        <p>FISH testing may also be performed in select instances at the discretion of the reporting hematopathologist if he/she deems such studies diagnostically useful. Note: <em>MYC</em> immunohistochemical studies do not correlate with gene rearrangement status and cannot be used as a surrogate for <em>MYC</em> rearrangement in this context.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;3&quot;>
    <li><strong>Follicular Lymphoma</strong>: Must document grade (1&amp;ndash;2, 3a or 3b), because all grade 3b should receive R-CHOP rather than other chemotherapy regimens. Also, if a diffuse pattern is present, this should be specified and a relative proportion noted, as outlined in the WHO Classification. </li>
    <li><strong>Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma</strong>: Cytotoxic T-cell markers (CD8/CD57/Granzyme B) correlate with poor prognosis and should be considered. Notably, however, peripheral T cell lymphomas are not classified on the basis of these phenotypic markers. EBV studies by in situ hybridization (EBER) should be performed in cases where angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and extranodal T/natural killer (NK) cell lymphoma, nasal type enter in the differential diagnosis. </li>
    <li><strong>Mantle Cell Lymphoma</strong>: IHC for cyclin D1 and/or FISH for t(11;14) is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Poor prognostic features must be mentioned in the report, including blastoid and pleomorphic morphologic variants, as well as proliferation index as measured by Ki67 or Mib-1 (used to calculate Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index [MIPI] score). </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Mandatory Staging Procedures</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Pathology review whenever possible (essential for core needle biopsies) </li>
    <li>Complete history and physical examination stating Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Score, B symptoms </li>
    <li>Complete blood count (CBC) and differential </li>
    <li>Serum creatinine, electrolytes, alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin, total protein, albumin, calcium </li>
    <li>Hepatitis B surface antigen (must be done prior to initiating chemo/immunotherapy) </li>
    <li>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (for early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma) </li>
    <li>Beta-2-microglobulin </li>

<p>Treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphomas is based on histologic subtype, extent of disease, and age of the patient. In the case of <strong>discordant</strong> (2 separate sites of disease with differing types of lymphoma), <strong>composite</strong> (1 site of disease with 2 discrete types of lymphoma at that site), or <strong>transformed</strong> (a second lymphoma developing out of a background of previously known lymphoma) lymphoma, treatment must be directed at the most aggressive phase of the disease. Approaches outlined for aggressive lymphomas are generally applicable to both B- and T-cell types. However, treatments for lymphomas presenting at special sites, poor prognosis lymphomas in younger patients, and lymphomas arising in association with immunodeficiency (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], post-organ transplant) are outlined in the section titled &quot;Special Problems in Lymphoma Management&quot; below.</p>

<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*IPI Risk Factors for Advanced Stage: increased LDH, stage III/IV, &amp;gt;1 extranodal site, ECOG performance status 2&amp;ndash;4, age &amp;gt;60 years.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>**R-CEOP should be used for DLBCL patients who have prior cardiac disease and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. As presented by the BC Cancer Agency at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2009 Meeting (abstract 408), R-CEOP (etoposide 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV day 1 and 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> po days 2&amp;ndash;3) resulted in a 5 year time to progression (TTP) of 57% for 81 patients with DLBCL.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>***For patients &amp;gt;age 60 years, 3&amp;ndash;7 days of prednisone 100 mg/day pre-R-CHOP as well as granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis is recommended to decrease toxicity.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of proven benefit, intrathecal chemotherapy cannot be recommended even in high-risk situations where the risk of central nervous system (CNS) relapse is approximately 10% or higher.</p>
<p><em>Recommendations for Treatment</em></p>
<p>For DLBCL with associated high-risk features for relapse in the CNS, including all of: elevated LDH, ECOG=2&amp;ndash;4 <strong>and</strong> &amp;gt;1 extranodal site of involvement at diagnosis, CNS prophylaxis should involve high-dose intravenous (IV) methotrexate 3.5 g/m<sup>2</sup> x 3 doses mid-cycle (~day 15) of R-CHOP or rituximab + cyclophosphamide + adriamycin + vincristine + etoposide + prednisone (R-CHOEP) cycles 2, 4, and 6. For other high-risk presentations not fulfilling the 3 risk factors stated above (e.g., paranasal sinus, epidural, or testicular presentations), CNS prophylaxis should involve high-dose IV methotrexate 3.5 g/m<sup>2</sup> every 14&amp;ndash;28 days x 2&amp;ndash;3 doses after completion of all 6 cycles of R-CHOP. The overall chance of cure and patient co-morbidities should be considered before proceeding with methotrexate. For example, high-risk International Prognostic Index (IPI) DLBCL in elderly patients over age 70 years is associated with low progression-free survival rates, and poor tolerance of methotrexate, so CNS prophylaxis is probably not appropriate.</p>
<p><em>Treatment of Relapsed DLBCL</em></p>
<p>All patients younger than 65 to 70 years of age who experience disease persistence or progression after initial R-CHOP chemotherapy should be considered for high-dose salvage therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). These patients should be referred to the bone marrow transplant (BMT) clinic as soon as possible, or a transplant physician should be contacted directly to discuss management decisions. See the original guideline document for additional information on suggested management.</p>
<p>Selected patients with isolated CNS relapse/progression following complete response to R-CHOP-type induction therapy may be candidates for aggressive therapy as outlined in Appendix A, subheading VIII, section C (see the original guideline document). Unfortunately, most patients with secondary CNS lymphoma also have evidence of systemic disease progression, and experience poor response to salvage therapy, including high-dose methotrexate/cytarabine-based regimens. These patients are best managed with palliative intent, including possible use of intrathecal chemotherapy or palliative cranial radiotherapy.</p>
<p><em>Treatment of Special DLBCL Entities</em></p>

    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>

    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Follicular Lymphoma</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the following suggested treatment approach, 3 over-riding principles should be considered:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot;>
    <li>These are guidelines only. This disease often carries a long, incurable, remitting/relapsing natural history and, therefore, several treatment approaches are reasonable. </li>
    <li>The mere presence of disease does not alone imply the need for treatment. </li>
    <li>If therapy is required for predominantly localized disease, involved field radiation therapy (IFRT) should be considered in lieu of systemic pharmacological treatment as long as the radiotherapy can be done with minimal early or delayed side-effects (e.g., xerostomia, severe nausea/vomiting) and without eliminating future treatment options (e.g., should not radiate &amp;ge;25% bone marrow). Figure 2 in the original guideline document outlines the treatment algorithm for follicular lymphoma. </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Initial Therapy of Stage IA and Contiguous Stage IIA</em></p>
<p>IFRT 24 Gy/12&amp;ndash;30 Gy/20 fractions is recommended for newly-diagnosed patients with stage IA or contiguous non-bulky stage IIA follicular lymphoma, even if the patient is asymptomatic.</p>
<p><em>Initial Therapy of Advanced Stage Disease (Stage III/IV, B symptoms, or Bulky Stage I/II)</em></p>
<p>Indications for systemic therapy (usually stage III/IV or bulky stage I/II) include:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Patient symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss, malaise, pain, nausea) </li>
    <li>Significant lymphadenopathy (&amp;gt;7 cm mass, &amp;ge;3 sites and &amp;ge;3 cm, rapidly progressive) </li>
    <li>Splenomegaly &amp;ge;6 cm below costal margin, or hypersplenism, or pain </li>
    <li>Impending organ compromise (compression, pleural/pericardial effusions, ascites) </li>
    <li>Cytopenias secondary to bone marrow infiltration </li>
    <li>Patient preference because of anxiety and poor quality of life without treatment </li>
</ul>
<p>For patients who do not have any of the above indications for therapy, the recommended approach is to observe with (or arrange) follow-up clinical assessments every 3 to 6 months (&quot;watchful waiting&quot;).</p>
<p>For grades 1, 2, 3a follicular lymphoma who have an indication for therapy, the recommended therapy involves 6 cycles of bendamustine-rituximab (B-R) chemotherapy, followed in responding patients by 2 years of maintenance rituximab (375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV single dose every 3 months for total of 8 doses). In patients with previously untreated indolent lymphoma, B-R can be considered as a preferred first-line treatment approach to R-CHOP because of increased progression-free survival and fewer side-effects. Patients who have limited life-expectancy from co-morbid illness, or who do not want IV therapy, may be treated with oral chlorambucil or fludarabine monotherapy.</p>
<p>For grade 3b follicular lymphoma or DLBCL with areas of follicular lymphoma, R-CHOP should be used. Rituximab maintenance has not been proven effective following R-CHOP therapy for large B-cell lymphoma, and therefore is not recommended.</p>
<p><em>Therapy of Relapsed Disease</em></p>
<p>Therapeutic recommendations for recurrent follicular lymphoma need to be individualized, and no one recommendation is suitable for all patients. Numerous factors need to be taken into consideration before recommending therapy for recurrent follicular lymphoma, including:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Patient factors: Age, co-morbidity, symptoms, short- vs. long-term goals, preservation of future options, reimbursement/ability to pay for expensive treatments, acceptance of risks/toxicities of treatment option relative to potential benefit (response rate [RR], progression-free survival [PFS], overall survival [OS]) </li>
    <li>Disease factors: Stage, sites of involvement, grade, transformation, prior therapy, time from prior therapy (disease-free interval) </li>
</ul>

    <li>Serum B2-microglobulin: for prognostic evaluation </li>
    <li>Bone marrow biopsy: intratrabecular monoclonal lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, ranging from predominantly lymphocytic to lymphoplasmacytic to overt plasma cells </li>
    <li>CT of the abdomen and pelvis: to detect organomegaly and lymphadenopathy (skeletal surveys and bone scans are not necessary in absence of symptoms) </li>
    <li>Blood or plasma viscosity: if signs and symptoms of hyperviscosity syndrome (HVS) or IgM &amp;gt;50 g/L </li>
    <li>Direct antiglobulin test and cold agglutinin titre if positive </li>
    <li>Cryoglobulins </li>
</ol>
<p><em>IgM Monoclonal Protein Response Assessment in WM</em></p>
<p>Serum IgM monoclonal protein should be measured by serum protein electrophoresis. The use of nephelometry to determine total serum IgM should be discouraged because this method is unreliable, especially when the levels of monoclonal protein are high. The presence of cryoglobulin or cold agglutinin may affect determination of IgM; therefore, testing of cryoglobulin and cold agglutinin at baseline should be considered, and if present, serum samples should be reevaluated at 37&amp;deg;C to ensure accurate and consistent determination of the monoclonal protein levels.</p>
<p><em>HVS in LPL</em></p>
<p>Symptoms and signs of hyperviscosity include spontaneous bleeding, neurological symptoms and retinopathy. Patients with HVS have an expanded plasma volume and cardiac failure may also occur. In patients with WM the actual plasma volume may exceed that calculated and a 1&amp;ndash;1.5 volume exchange is therefore advisable.</p>
<p><em>General Treatment Guidelines for LPL/WM</em></p>
<p>The usual indications for starting patients with LPL/WM on active therapy consist of clinical evidence of adverse effects of the paraprotein (HVS with neurological or ocular disturbance, peripheral neuropathy, amyloidosis, symptomatic cryoglobulinemia), blood cytopenias (hemoglobin [Hb] &amp;lt;100, platelets &amp;lt;100), progression to high-grade lymphoma, significant adenopathy or organomegaly, or constitutional symptoms.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><em>Plasmapheresis</em>: 1&amp;ndash;2 procedures, exchanging 1&amp;ndash;1.5 calculated plasma volumes, are advised for the treatment of HVS in WM, followed by chemotherapy to prevent paraprotein re-accumulation. In patients who are drug-resistant, plasmapheresis may be indicated for long-term management. The treatment room should be warm and blood warmers used in the cell separator circuit to prevent precipitation during the procedure. </li>
    <li><em>Chemotherapy</em>: The most common initial chemotherapy for LPL is B-R followed by rituximab maintenance, similar to other indolent B-cell lymphomas. Alkylating agent-based therapy or purine analogues are also reasonable for the initial and subsequent treatment of WM, especially for older patients with significant co-morbid illnesses. There is no consensus on the duration of treatment with cladribine or fludarabine, or on which purine analogue is superior. While fludarabine is more active than cyclophosphamide + adriamycin + prednisone (CAP) as salvage therapy, neither of these therapies has been shown to offer survival benefit over another. Rituximab is active in the treatment of WM but associated with the risk of transient exacerbation of clinical effects of the disease and should be used with caution in patients with symptoms of hyperviscosity and/or IgM levels &amp;gt;40 g/L. ASCT is used with increasing frequency for LPL, and as such, purine analogue therapy and chlorambucil should be avoided as initial therapy for transplant-eligible patients to prevent stem cell damage and decrease the risk of blood mobilization failure in the future. </li>
    <li>Thalidomide is of potential use in the treatment of patients who have previously received alkylating agents, purine analogues and antibody therapy. Other agents are currently only recommended in the context of clinical trials. </li>
    <li>High-dose therapy supported by ASCT has a role in the management of selected patients with WM who have chemosensitive primary induction failure or relapsed disease (preferably first relapse). Autologous stem cell collection is often not possible for patients who have received more than 4 months of prior chlorambucil or purine analogue (fludarabine or 2-CDA) therapy. As with other indolent lymphomas, ASCT should be considered at second relapse, before the disease develops absolute chemoresistance. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Special Lymphomas</strong></p>
<p>These diagnoses sometimes constitute an oncologic emergency. Treatment may require intensive high-dose chemotherapy with CNS prophylaxis, and may need to begin within 48 hours, whether staging is complete or not. Patients should be seen for consultation at a major referral centre and may require complicated high-dose chemotherapy regimens. Acceptable treatment approaches for some of the entities (mantle cell lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, Burkitt's and high-grade B-cell Burkitt's-like lymphoma) are outlined in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Special Problems in Lymphoma Management</strong></p>
<p><em>Gastric Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) Lymphoma</em></p>
<p>For complete staging evaluation, patients with gastric MALT lymphoma require gastroscopy and multiple large deep biopsies stained for <em>Helicobacter pylori</em>. Stage IAE low-grade gastric MALT should be treated with omeprazole 20 mg twice daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and either metronidazole 500 mg twice daily or amoxicillin 1,000 mg twice daily for&amp;nbsp;1 week, or an equally effective regimen such as lansoprazole + clarithromycin + amoxicillin (Hp-PAC). After treatment with antibiotics, patients should undergo repeat gastroscopy at 3 months, then every 6 months for 2 years, then annually for 3 years. Biopsies should be taken for lymphoma and <em>H pylori</em> each time. One re-treatment should be tried if <em>H pylori</em> persists. MALT lymphoma may slowly regress over 12 to 18 months after <em>H pylori</em> eradication. If lymphoma recurs or persists more than 12 to 18 months after eradication of <em>H pylori</em>, the patient should receive upper abdominal irradiation (30 Gy/20 fractions with<span> POP </span>if anatomy permits, otherwise 4&amp;ndash;5 field plan with superior portion anteroposterior (AP)/PA and inferior portion AP, R lateral and L lateral). Patients could also be considered for IFRT rather than <em>H pylori</em> therapy if the tumour is associated with t(11;18), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB), or nuclear bcl-10 expression. Stage IIAE or greater gastric MALT should be managed as advanced low-grade lymphoma plus eradication of <em>H pylori</em> with antibiotics. Other histologies of gastric lymphoma should be managed as per the sections on aggressive lymphomas or follicular lymphomas found in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><em>Testicular Lymphoma</em></p>
<p>In contrast to other patients with localized large B-cell lymphoma, patients with stage IAE or IIAE testicular lymphoma are cured less than 50% of the time using brief chemotherapy and irradiation. Thus, the recommended treatment for all stages of testicular lymphoma is a full course of chemotherapy (R-CHOP x 6 cycles). An additional problem often seen in these patients is relapse in the opposite testicle. This can be prevented by scrotal irradiation (25&amp;ndash;30 Gy/10&amp;ndash;15 fractions). Finally, these patients are at high risk for CNS relapse. Although some experts recommend prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy, especially for stages 3&amp;ndash;4 disease, this has not been proven effective. Unfortunately, many of the CNS relapses occur within the brain parenchyma, and are not prevented by intrathecal chemotherapy. For this reason, CNS prophylaxis should involve high-dose IV methotrexate 3.5 g/m<sup>2</sup> every 14 to 28 days x 2&amp;ndash;3 doses after completion of all 6 cycles of R-CHOP.</p>
<p><em>Primary CNS Lymphoma (PCNSL)</em></p>
<p>Diagnosis of PCNSL is based on a biopsy of the brain lesion, or pathological examination of a vitrectomy or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimen. A bone marrow biopsy and CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is required to rule out systemic disease. Required staging tests include ophthalmologic slit lamp exam and CSF cytology (only if lumbar puncture is not contraindicated because of intracranial hypertension and midline shift). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology should also be obtained. If initial CSF cytology is obtained while the patient is receiving corticosteroids and is negative, it should be obtained 1 month after completing all therapy, after corticosteroids have been discontinued.</p>
<p>Treatment of PCNSL involves induction chemotherapy based upon high-dose methotrexate 3.5&amp;ndash;5 g/m<sup>2</sup> every 2 weeks for 4&amp;ndash;5 doses. Intrathecal methotrexate has not been shown to be beneficial if high-dose methotrexate is used. It is recommended to use high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine during induction therapy for PCNSL.</p>
<p>For a detailed description of recommended PCNSL treatment regimens, please refer to Appendix A, subheading VIII, sections A and B in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>For palliative therapy, doses of cranial radiotherapy should be 30 Gy in 10&amp;ndash;20 fractions.</p>
<p><em>Eye Lymphoma</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Orbital or Peri-orbital Lymphoma</span></p>
<p>Peri-orbital lymphoma of the bony orbit or the soft tissues in and around the orbit but outside of the globe and optic nerve should be managed as indicated in the earlier sections on aggressive lymphomas, marginal zone lymphomas or follicular lymphoma, as appropriate for the type and stage of the lymphoma. Approximately 40% of such patients have advanced disease discovered when carefully staged. In general, 25&amp;ndash;30 Gy/20 fractions radiotherapy to whole orbit/peri-orbital tissue is recommended for indolent peri-orbital lymphomas.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Conjunctival Lymphoma</span></p>
<p>Lymphoma involving the conjunctiva but not the structures within the globe or the optic nerve is usually of low grade and should be treated with 25&amp;ndash;30 Gy/20 fractions of radiotherapy. Doses, fields, and shielding specifically modified for treatment of the eye are necessary to minimize long-term complications such as xerophthalmia or cataract formation.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Intra-ocular and Optic Nerve Lymphoma</span></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Lymphoma involving the vitreous, retina or other structures within the optic nerve or globe is usually of large cell type and is equivalent to PCNSL. Bilateral involvement is common. Evaluation and management should be the same as for PCNSL. Acceptable treatment involves induction chemotherapy with high-dose methotrexate and high-dose cytarabine as described for PCNSL in Appendix A of the original guideline document </li>
    <li>Lymphoma involving the uveal structures (choroid) is a rare presentation of lymphoma, and is usually of indolent type. This disease is best managed with treatment appropriate for stage and local extent of disease </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cutaneous Lymphoma</em></p>
<p>Cutaneous lymphomas should be treated according to histological type and site of presentation. In general, B-cell lymphomas are localized and T-cell lymphomas tend to be disseminated. Diagnosis requires full thickness punch or excisional skin biopsy of lesion, and no involved sites other than skin for 6 months after diagnosis. Staging tests are required as described in the staging section above.</p>

<p><strong>Aggressive T-Cell Lymphomas</strong></p>
<p><em>NK/T-cell Lymphoma, Nasal Type</em></p>
<p>NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type is a rare and aggressive extranodal neoplasm that almost exclusively affects Asian and South American adults in the fifth decade of life, with a male:female ratio of approximately 3:1. It typically arises in the nasal cavity or surrounding structures, such as the sinuses, palate, nasopharynx, tonsils, hypopharynx, and larynx. While the pathogenesis of NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type is not well understood, EBV is implicated in almost all cases. Approximately 25% of cases show a p53 mutation; in addition, p21 over-expression is also frequent in nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma, and seems to be independent of p53 gene status.</p>
<p>Hematopathological evaluation of a biopsy specimen from the site of involvement is the basis for diagnosis of nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma. The recommended immunohistochemistry panel includes:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>B-cell: CD20 </li>
    <li>T-lineage antigens: CD2, CD7, CD8, CD4, CD5, CD3 </li>
    <li>NK lineage markers: CD56 </li>
    <li>Ki-67 </li>
    <li><em>In situ</em> hybridization for EBV-encoded ribonucleic acid (RNA) (EBER) </li>
</ul>
<p>For patients with early-stage nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma, early or upfront radiotherapy (intensive regimens such as a total dose 50&amp;ndash;54 Gy, or an accelerated dose of 30 Gy/10 fractions) plays an essential role in therapy, and has been associated with higher overall survival and complete response rates compared to chemotherapy alone. However, radiotherapy alone is associated with high relapse rates. Combined modality therapy is recommended.</p>
<p>For patients with stage III&amp;ndash;IV disease, complete remission rates are less than 15%, and the median overall survival is approximately 4 months. The recommended options for therapy include either enrollment in a clinical trial or treatment with an L-asparaginase-based combination chemotherapy regimen. Allogeneic or autologous SCT could also be considered in patients with disseminated disease that is responsive to chemotherapy, although data is limited.</p>
<p><em>Peripheral T-cell Lymphomas (PTCL</em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>)</span></p>
<p>With the exception of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, CHOP chemotherapy cures less than 30% of patients with PTCL. Options that may be associated with higher cure rates include CHOP x 4&amp;ndash;6 cycles followed by HDCT/ASCT in responding patients or intensification of CHOP with etoposide (CHOEP).</p>
<p>For PTCL patients who relapse following CHOP-type induction and respond to salvage therapy, ASCT should be recommended, as several studies report similar ASCT outcomes to those seen with relapsed DLBCL.</p>
<p>Summary of treatment recommendations for PTCL:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot;>
    <li>Anaplastic large cell lymphoma, ALK positive: CHOP x 6 cycles </li>
    <li>NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Recommendation for stage I&amp;ndash;II NK/T-cell lymphoma: IFRT as initial therapy (either 30 Gy/10 fractions IFRT or concurrent 40&amp;ndash;50 Gy IFRT+ weekly cisplatin 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) then follow IFRT with etoposide + ifosfamide + cisplatin + dexamethasone (VIPD) x 3 cycles (etoposide 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> days 1&amp;ndash;3 + ifosfamide 1.2 g/m<sup>2</sup> days 1&amp;ndash;3 + cisplatin 33 mg/m<sup>2</sup> days 1&amp;ndash;3 + dexamethasone 40 mg days 1&amp;ndash;4) </li>
        <li>If IFRT must be delayed for 2 or more weeks after diagnosis due to scheduling issues, then days 1&amp;ndash;4 of GDP could be administered while waiting for IFRT </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>All other subtypes of PTCL:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>&amp;lt;60 years of age with IPI=0&amp;ndash;2: CHOEP x 6 cycles </li>
        <li>&amp;lt;60 years of age with IPI=3&amp;ndash;5: CHOEP x 4 cycles, then mobilize stem cells with high-dose methotrexate (MTX) 3.5 g/m<sup>2</sup> IV day 1 and cytarabine 3 g/m<sup>2</sup> IV days 9&amp;ndash;10, G-CSF 480&amp;ndash;600 mg subcutaneously (SC) daily days 16&amp;ndash;21 followed by apheresis days 22&amp;ndash;23, then HDCT/ASCT </li>
        <li>&amp;gt;60 years of age: CHOP or CEOP x 6 cycles +/- HDCT/ASCT, or cyclophosphamide + etoposide + methotrexate + dexamethasone + leucovorin + G-CSF (CMED) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)-Related Lymphomas</em></p>
<p>In general, the treatment of AIDS-related lymphoma should be the same as for non-AIDS related lymphoma if the AIDS does not otherwise compromise the patient's performance status and he/she is free of coincident serious opportunistic infection. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) should be given with CHOP chemotherapy. R-CHOP results in the highest rates of disease-free survival, but may also increase the risk of infectious complications and treatment-related mortality in patients with CD4 counts below 50.</p>
<p><em>Post-transplant Lymphoproliferative Disease (PTLD)</em></p>
<p>PTLD may have a variety of histological presentations, and all diagnoses require review by an expert hematopathologist. Treatment of PTLD requires close collaboration between the organ transplant team and lymphoma team. Transplant patients receiving immunosuppressant medications tolerate chemotherapy poorly, often developing profound and prolonged pancytopenia.</p>
<p>General treatment principles include:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The immunosuppression should be reduced to the absolute minimum, zero if possible, even if that requires endangering the grafted organ. Some lymphomas, especially polymorphic PTLDs that developed within the first 2 years of organ transplantation, will spontaneously regress if the immunosuppression can be sufficiently reduced </li>
    <li>If reduction of immunosuppression fails to control the lymphoma, a member of the core group should be consulted to determine if rituximab alone, R-chemotherapy, radiotherapy, interferon, or novel experimental treatment would be of use </li>
</ul>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Hodgkin Lymphoma</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Pathologic Classification</strong></p>
<p>The histological sub-classification of Hodgkin lymphoma is based on the light microscopic hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E) interpretation. If problems with differential diagnosis arise, staining for CD15, CD30, T-cell and B-cell panels and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) may be helpful. For lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, CD20, CD45, +/- CD57 are recommended.</p>
<p>Refer to Table 9 in the original guideline document for the WHO classification of histologic subtypes of Hodgkin lymphoma.</p>
<p><strong>Staging</strong></p>
<p>Mandatory staging procedures include:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Pathology review whenever possible (essential for core needle biopsies) </li>
    <li>Complete history and physical examination (B symptoms, Etoh intolerance, pruritis, fatigue, ECOG performance score, examination of nodes, Waldeyer's ring, spleen, liver, skin) </li>
    <li>CBC and differential, creatinine, electrolytes, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, LDH, bilirubin, total protein, albumin, calcium </li>
    <li>ESR </li>
    <li>Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy (2 cm core preferable) for stage IIB&amp;ndash;IV or cytopenias (<em><strong>Note</strong>: flow cytometry on the marrow aspirate does not add useful information and should not be done</em>) </li>
    <li>Chest x-ray (PA and lateral) </li>
    <li>CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, it may be useful to perform the following procedures in selected cases:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>PET scan, especially for clinical stage I&amp;ndash;IIA by standard CT imaging </li>
    <li>Ear, nose, and throat (ENT) exam for clinical stage I&amp;ndash;IIA upper cervical (above hyoid) nodal disease </li>
    <li>Pregnancy test, if at risk </li>
    <li>Fertility and/or psychosocial counseling </li>
    <li>Pneumococcal, flu, meningococcal vaccines if splenectomy or splenic radiotherapy is contemplated </li>
    <li>Semen cryopreservation if chemotherapy or pelvic radiotherapy is contemplated </li>
    <li>Oophoropexy if premenopausal and pelvic radiotherapy is contemplated </li>
    <li>HIV: risk factors, unusual disease presentations&amp;nbsp; </li>

<p><strong>Nodular Lymphocyte Predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma</strong></p>
<p>This rare subtype comprises approximately 5% of all Hodgkin lymphomas and is recognized to have a very indolent nature, as well as excellent survival. Many patients present with limited stage disease and, given the excellent prognosis, many centres advocate less intensive therapy than for classical Hodgkin, including surgery alone, watch-and-wait, or isolated IFRT. A recent retrospective study suggests that treatment with combination therapy (with ABVD x 2 cycles followed by IFRT) may be superior to IFRT alone. Given a lack of quality evidence to suggest that nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma should be treated differently from classical Hodgkin lymphoma, most patients should be treated similar to the previous guidelines for classical Hodgkin lymphoma.</p>

<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Supportive Care in the Treatment of Lymphoma</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Neutropenia Prevention</strong></p>
<p>Primary or secondary prophylaxis to decrease the risk of febrile neutropenia and maintain chemotherapy dose intensity is indicated when treating with curative intent (e.g., preventing treatment delay/dose reduction). The recommendation for R-CHOP, ABVD, CODOX-M/IVAC, HyperCVAD, or intensive salvage therapy regimens, with or without rituximab (e.g., dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, cisplatin [DHAP]; ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide [ICE]; GDP; mesna rescue, ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide [MICE]; DICEP), in patients with aggressive Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma older than 60 years of age, or poor prognostic factors (high IPI or IPS) is G-CSF 300 &amp;mu;g subcutaneous on days 8 and 12 of a 14- or 21-day chemotherapy regimen.</p>
<p>For primary prophylaxis of febrile neutropenic infection for similar indications above or co-morbidities that increase risk of infectious complications such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or secondary prevention after a prior episode of febrile neutropenia:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>G-CSF 300 or 480 &amp;mu;g/day starting 3 days after chemotherapy completed until post-nadir absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &amp;gt;1.0 (usually 7&amp;ndash;10 days) </li>
    <li>Must monitor CBC </li>
    <li>The alternative is one dose of pegfilgrastim (Neulasta) 6 mg on day 4 (without CBC monitoring, but at a cost of ~$2,500/dose) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Erythropoietin</strong></p>
<p>Erythropoietin is not recommended because of evidence suggesting increased mortality rates. Consider only for symptomatic anemia patients who cannot receive red blood cell (RBC) transfusions (i.e., Jehovah's Witnesses, prior severe transfusion reactions or severe iron overload).</p>
<p><strong>Antimicrobial Prophylaxis for Immunosuppressive Regimens</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Includes fludarabine, high dose cyclophosphamide, &amp;gt;5 days high dose corticosteroids every 21 days, especially with other immune suppressive agents such as bortezomib </li>
    <li>For immune-compromised patients (i.e., HIV, post-organ transplant or autoimmune disease patients who develop hematologic cancers) use prophylaxis during and for 3&amp;ndash;6 months post-treatment </li>
    <li><em>Pneumocystis jiroveci</em> pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Choice 1: Septra 1 regular strength tab daily </li>
        <li>Choice 2: dapsone 100 mg every Monday/Wednesday/Friday (or daily) </li>
        <li>Choice 3: pentamidine 300 mg inhalation monthly </li>
        <li>Choice 4: atovaquone 750 mg daily </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Shingles prophylaxis: valacyclovir 500 mg daily </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Immunizations</strong></p>
<p>Patients should be encouraged to keep all immunizations up to date. The reactivation and/or seroreversion of viruses that patients have been previously vaccinated against, such as hepatitis B, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hematologic malignancies treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Appendix G of the original guideline document outlines the general principles and specific immunization schedules for recipients of blood and marrow transplantations. See the National Guideline Clearinghouse summary of the CancerControl Alberta guideline <a href=&quot;/content.aspx?id=47837&quot; title=&quot;Guideline #10255&quot;>Influenza immunization for adult and pediatric patients undergoing cancer treatment</a>.</p>
<p>Family members and health care providers in contact with patients who have undergone a transplant should also be strongly encouraged to keep all immunizations up to date.</p>
<p>For patients who have experienced reactivation or seroreversion of hepatitis B virus, prompt administration of nucleoside/nucleotide analogues is essential. Lamivudine 100 mg/day during and for 3 months following R-CVP or R-CHOP chemotherapy for lymphoma is recommended for all patients who have a positive hepatitis B surface antigen test.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Follow-up Care in the Treatment of Lymphoma</strong></span></p>
<p>The following late effects should be considered when patients are reviewed during follow-up:</p>
<p><strong>Relapse</strong></p>
<p>Careful attention should be directed to lymph node sites, especially if previously involved with disease.</p>
<p><strong>Dental Caries</strong></p>
<p>Neck or oropharyngeal irradiation may cause decreased salivation. Patients should have careful dental care follow-up and should make their dentist aware of the previous irradiation.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothyroidism</strong></p>
<p>After external beam thyroid irradiation to doses sufficient to cure malignant lymphoma, at least 50% of patients will eventually develop hypothyroidism. All patients whose thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level becomes elevated should be treated with life-long thyroxine (T4) replacement in doses sufficient to suppress TSH levels to low normal.</p>
<p><strong>Infertility</strong></p>
<p>Multi-agent chemotherapy and direct or scatter radiation to gonadal tissue may cause infertility, amenorrhea, or premature menopause. However, with current chemotherapy regimens and radiation fields used, most patients will not develop these problems. All patients should be advised that they may or may not be fertile after treatment. In general, women who continue menstruating are fertile, but men require semen analysis to provide a specific answer.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary Neoplasms</strong></p>
<p>Although quite uncommon, certain neoplasms occur with increased frequency in patients who have been treated for lymphoma. These include AML, thyroid, breast, lung, and upper gastrointestinal (GI) carcinoma, melanoma and cervical carcinoma <em>in situ</em>. It is appropriate to screen for these neoplasms by careful history, physical examination, mammography and Pap smears for the rest of the patient's life because they may have a lengthy induction period. Patients should be counseled about the hazards of smoking and excessive sun exposure, and should be encouraged to perform careful breast and skin examinations on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The table below outlines the minimum follow-up tests and examinations that should be performed on all patients after treatment for malignant lymphoma. Visits should be scheduled with an oncologist or family physician educated in post-treatment lymphoma surveillance every 3 to 4 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years, then annually.</p>

<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Medical journal articles were searched using Medline (1950 to October Week 1, 2011), EMBASE (1980 to October Week 1, 2011), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (3rd Quarter, 2011), and PubMed electronic databases. An updated review of the relevant existing practice guidelines for lymphoma was also conducted by accessing the websites of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), Cancer Care Ontario (CCO), the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA), the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), and the British Committee for Standards in Haematology.</p></div>"/>

<p>The working group members formulated the guideline recommendations based on the evidence synthesized by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist during the planning process, blended with expert clinical interpretation of the evidence. As detailed in the <a href=&quot;http://www.albertahealthservices.ca/hp/if-hp-cancer-guide-utilization-handbook.pdf&quot; title=&quot;Alberta Health Service Web site&quot;>Guideline Utilization Resource Unit Handbook</a> (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field), the working group members may decide to adopt the recommendations of another institution without any revisions, adapt the recommendations of another institution or institutions to better reflect local practices, or develop their own set of recommendations by adapting some, but not all, recommendations from different guidelines.</p>
<p>The degree to which a recommendation is based on expert opinion of the working group and/or the Provincial Tumour Team members is explicitly stated in the guideline recommendations. Similar to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) methodology for formulating guideline recommendations, the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU) does not use formal rating schemes for describing the strength of the recommendations, but rather describes, in conventional and explicit language, the type and quality of the research and existing guidelines that were taken into consideration when formulating the recommendations.</p></div>"/>

<p>When the draft guideline document has been completed, revised, and reviewed by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist and the working group members, it is sent to all members of the Provincial Tumour Team for review and comment. This step ensures that those intended to use the guideline have the opportunity to review the document and identify potential difficulties for implementation before the guideline is finalized. Depending on the size of the document, and the number of people it is sent to for review, a deadline of one to two weeks will usually be given to submit any feedback. Ideally, this review will occur prior to the annual Provincial Tumour Team meeting, and a discussion of the proposed edits will take place at the meeting. The working group members will then make final revisions to the document based on the received feedback, as appropriate. Once the guideline is finalized, it will be officially endorsed by the Provincial Tumour Team Lead and the Executive Director of Provincial Tumour Programs.</p></div>"/>
