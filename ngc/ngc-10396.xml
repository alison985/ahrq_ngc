	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>All newborns and infants with confirmed hearing loss should undergo a comprehensive evaluation in which patient-focused medical and birth histories and a three-generation pedigree and family medical history are obtained, and a physical examination that focuses on dysmorphic physical findings is performed. Evaluation of children and young adults with hearing loss should follow a similar approach. Evaluation of deaf or hard-of-hearing adults should be customized based on the age of onset and other characteristics of the hearing loss (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document).
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>The medical and birth histories may be helpful in differentiating between acquired versus inherited causes of hearing loss. Elements of medical and birth histories focused on hearing loss include the following:
        <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
            <li>Prenatal history, including maternal infections (e.g., cytomegalovirus [CMV], rubella) and illnesses (e.g., syphilis), or medication or drug exposures (e.g., thalidomide, retinoic acid) </li>
            <li>Neonatal history, including premature birth, low birth weight, birth hypoxia, hyperbilirubinemia, sepsis, and exposure to ototoxic medications </li>
            <li>Postnatal history, including viral illnesses, bacterial meningitis, head trauma, noise exposure, and exposure to ototoxic medications </li>
            <li>Audiometric assessment of the hearing loss, including sensorineural versus conductive or mixed hearing loss; age of onset; progressive, nonprogressive, or fluctuating nature of the hearing loss; laterality, symmetry, severity, and configuration of the hearing loss; and the presence or absence of vestibular dysfunction or auditory neuropathy </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The pedigree and family medical history should focus on identifying the following:
        <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
            <li>First- and second-degree relatives with hearing loss or with features commonly associated with hearing loss (such as pigmentary, branchial, or renal anomalies) or sudden cardiac death </li>
            <li>A pattern of inheritance </li>
            <li>Ethnicity and country of origin </li>
            <li>A common origin from ethnically or geographically isolated areas </li>
            <li>Consanguinity </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The physical examination should focus on dysmorphic and other physical findings such as the following:
        <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
            <li>Unusual facial appearance, with attention to asymmetry </li>
            <li>Pigmentary anomalies </li>
            <li>Neck, skin, facial, or ear anomalies </li>
            <li>Neurological abnormalities </li>
            <li>Balance disturbances </li>
            <li>Skeletal abnormalities </li>
            <li>Other unusual physical findings </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;2&quot;>
    <li>For individuals with findings that suggest a syndromic genetic etiology for their hearing loss:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Pretest genetic counseling should be provided, and, with patient's informed consent, genetic testing, if available, should be ordered to confirm the diagnosis&amp;mdash;this testing may include single-gene tests, hearing loss sequencing panels, whole-exome sequencing (WES), whole-genome sequencing (WGS), chromosome analysis, or microarray-based copy-number analysis, depending on clinical findings. </li>
        <li>Appropriate studies should be undertaken to determine whether other organs are involved. </li>
        <li>Appropriate near-term and long-term screening and management should be arranged, including referrals to specialists, as indicated by the associated manifestations of the particular syndrome. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;3&quot;>
    <li>For individuals lacking physical findings suggestive of a known syndrome and having medical and birth histories that do not suggest an environmental cause of hearing loss, a tiered diagnostic approach should be implemented.
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Pretest genetic counseling should be provided, and, with patient's informed consent, genetic testing should be ordered.
        <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
            <li>Single-gene testing may be warranted in cases in which the medical or family history, or presentation of the hearing loss, suggests a specific etiology. For example, testing for mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mutations associated with aminoglycoside ototoxicity may be considered for individuals with a history of use of aminoglycoside antibiotics. </li>
            <li>In the absence of any specific clinical indications and for singleton cases and cases with apparent autosomal recessive inheritance, the next step should be testing for DFNB1-related hearing loss (due to mutations in <em>GJB2</em> and adjacent deletions in <em>GJB6</em>). </li>
            <li>If initial genetic testing is negative, genetic testing using gene panel tests, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies such as large sequencing panels targeted toward hearing loss&amp;ndash;related genes, WES, or WGS may be considered. Because several tests are clinically available, the clinician must be aware of the genes included in the test (panel) chosen and the performance characteristics of the platform chosen, including coverage, analytic sensitivity, and what types of mutations will be detected. It should be noted that the cost of these new genetic sequencing technologies is decreasing so rapidly that a tiered approach to testing may soon no longer be cost effective. In particular, for large sequencing panels targeted toward hearing loss&amp;ndash;related genes, it may, in some cases, already be more cost effective to use NGS technologies as the initial test in the evaluation of hearing loss. However, issues related to genomic testing, such as the likelihood of incidental findings, will have to be addressed. </li>
            <li>If genetic testing reveals mutation(s) in a hearing loss&amp;ndash;related gene, mutation-specific genetic counseling should be provided, followed by appropriate medical evaluations and referrals. </li>
            <li>If genetic testing fails to identify an etiology for a patient's hearing loss, the possibility of a genetic or acquired etiology remains. This point must be emphasized because it can be misunderstood by clinicians and by patients and their families. For interested patients and families, further genetic testing may be pursued on a research basis. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Temporal bone imaging by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging should be considered as a complement to genetic testing, particularly if the diagnosis remains unclear, if cochlear implantation is being considered, if auditory neuropathy is noted, in cases of progressive hearing loss, or if other clinical concerns exist. The anticipated clinical utility of imaging studies should be balanced against the risks associated with radiation exposure and sedation. </li>
        <li>CMV testing should be done at the same time as genetic testing for infants with congenital hearing loss. For later-onset or progressive hearing loss, CMV testing can be obtained, but the likelihood that a positive test is due to postnatal exposure increases with age. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;4&quot;>
    <li>Referral to a multidisciplinary care center, when available, is recommended.
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>A team approach that includes otolaryngologists, clinical geneticists, genetic counselors, audiologists, speech and language specialists, early hearing intervention and family support specialists (which may include other individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing or other parents of deaf or hard-of-hearing children), and other appropriate specialists offers optimal opportunity to provide ongoing management and support of deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals and their families as their needs change over time. </li>
        <li>For cases in which the genetic evaluation failed to identify an underlying cause, periodic follow-up care every 3 years with a geneticist may be appropriate for several reasons. First, subtle features of syndromic forms of hearing loss may not be apparent at birth or early in childhood but may appear as deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals grow into adulthood. These may prompt additional medical tests or referrals for specialty care. Second, follow-up visits offer the opportunity to inform individuals about new genetic tests that may have become available or changes in the interpretation of previous test results as medical knowledge advances. Finally, follow-up visits may also help identify clinical concerns unrelated to hearing loss, for which referral for specialty care may be appropriate (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document). </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;5&quot;>
    <li>Regardless of whether genetic test results are positive, negative, or inconclusive, results should be communicated through the process of genetic counseling. </li>
