<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>New Information in This Guideline Since 2006 Publication</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Aetiology and Epidemiology</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is now hyperendemic among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United Kingdom (UK); higher levels than in 2005 </li>
    <li>No evidence of significant heterosexual spread within the UK </li>
    <li>Cases continue to be mostly MSM, most of whom were also known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive and many co-infected with other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including hepatitis C virus (HCV) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>Commercial molecular diagnostic techniques to detect <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> (<em>C. trachomatis</em>) remain the primary test of choice, with referral of <em>C. trachomatis</em>-positive specimens for molecular tests to confirm the presence of LGV-associated deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)</p>
<p><strong>Management</strong></p>
<p>First-line treatment remains doxycycline 100 mg twice a day (BD) for 3 weeks. Evidence for the role of other antibiotics remains scarce, but azithromycin in multiple-dose regimens may be preferable to erythromycin.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Diagnosis</span></strong></p>
<p>In the past, the diagnosis of LGV has often been one of exclusion after other causes of genital ulcer disease (GUD) or inguinal lymphadenopathy have been ruled out. In the case of anorectal syndrome, particularly in MSM, the diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion (e.g., combination of signs of proctocolitis, inguinal lymphadenopathy and history of genital ulcer would be highly suggestive) after the exclusion of other aetiologies of proctitis. Even when LGV is suspected, investigations for other potentially co-existing STIs must be undertaken, in particular for gonorrhoea, herpes simplex virus and syphilis.</p>
<p>Positive diagnosis of LGV remains difficult in resource-poor settings, requiring a combination of good clinical acumen and supportive investigations. LGV can be suspected in the presence of positive chlamydial serology, isolation of <em>C. trachomatis</em> from the infected site or histological identification of <em>C. trachomatis</em> in infected tissue. Traditional methods for LGV diagnosis have been reviewed elsewhere, but modern techniques now rely on nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). The assays have high sensitivity and specificity and are able to detect LGV-associated DNA, not only from genital swabs but also rectal and throat swabs, urine, bubo pus, lymph node aspirates and biopsy specimens.</p>
<p>The identification of rectal polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNLs) from rectal swabs is predictive of LGV proctitis, especially in HIV-positive MSM, with levels of &amp;gt;10 and &amp;gt;20 PMNLs per high-power field both shown to be significant.</p>
<p>Testing guidelines for referral of specimens for LGV DNA testing have been developed by the Sexually Transmitted Bacteria Reference Laboratory/Scottish Reference Laboratory (STBRL; Public Health England [PHE], UK).</p>
<p><strong>Collection of Specimens</strong></p>
<p>Chlamydiae are intracellular organisms so samples should aim to contain cellular material, which can be obtained from:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The ulcer base exudate or from rectal mucosa </li>
    <li>Aspiration of enlarged or fluctuant lymph nodes or buboes; after topical disinfection, a 21-gauge needle should be inserted into the lymph node through healthy adjacent tissue and the pus aspirated into a syringe; a small volume (&amp;lt;0.5 mL) saline solution may be injected and re-aspirated for non-fluctuant nodes. If using culture, bubo pus is best homogenized in tissue culture medium before inoculation; if using a <em>C. trachomatis</em> NAAT, express pus onto the swab and transport to the laboratory in the standard collection kit for that assay. </li>
    <li>Rectal and pharyngeal swabs from MSM and women exposed at those sites; these should be collected as recommended in British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) guidelines </li>
    <li>A urethral swab or first-catch urine specimen; these can be used when urethritis and/or inguinal lymphadenopathy is present and LGV is suspected as the cause, as well as a swab from any suspected primary lesion </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Main Diagnostic Techniques</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Detection of <em>C. trachomatis</em> nucleic acid (DNA/ribonucleic acid [RNA]) by NAATs such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), strand displacement amplification (SDA) or transcription mediated amplification (TMA); these methods are now established for routine testing of urethral, cervical, urine, rectal and pharyngeal specimens and are highly sensitive and specific, including from the rectal site; <em>C. trachomatis</em>-positive samples should be confirmed by real-time PCR for LGV-specific DNA in cases of suspected LGV; only detection of LGV DNA confirms the diagnosis. The current guidelines from the STBRL/Scottish Reference Laboratory advise that LGV DNA testing should only be performed on specimens that have been confirmed as <em>C. trachomatis</em> positive at the local laboratory using a NAAT and have been sourced from either a symptomatic patient or a direct sexual contact. Either the residual processed NAAT specimen or a dry unprocessed specimen will be accepted.
    <p>or</p>
    </li>
    <li>Culture on cycloheximide-treated McCoy cells of material from suspected LGV lesions has a sensitivity of 75% to 85% at best, and less for bubo aspirates; this method is labour-intensive, expensive and of increasingly restricted availability.
    <p>or</p>
    </li>
    <li>Chlamydia serology. Four types of techniques have been used: the complement fixation (CF) test, the single L-type immunofluorescence test, the microimmunofluorescence test (micro-IF) and the anti-major outer membrane protein (MOMP) immunoglobulin A (IgA) assay. In general, a four-fold rise in antibody or single-point titres of &amp;gt;1/64 and &amp;gt;128 for the micro-IF test has been considered positive, as only an invasive infection such as that caused by LGV could be responsible for such high titres. The test lacks sensitivity for the earlier manifestations of LGV such as ulcers, and a high titre in the absence of symptoms cannot confirm LGV. It is only performed in a few specialised laboratories. Dutch investigators showed the anti-MOMP IgA to be the most useful assay for rectal LGV infection but sensitivity and specificity reached only ~75% in asymptomatic MSM with rectal <em>C. trachomatis</em>. Serology cannot necessarily distinguish past from current LGV infection, which might prove restrictive given the high number of recurrent LGV infections now seen in MSM. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Other Methods</strong></p>
<p>Histology of the lymph nodes shows follicular hyperplasia and abscesses, but such findings are not specific; nonetheless, histopathologists need to be alert to these changes and include LGV in the differential diagnosis. In a recent study of 12 anorectal biopsies from MSM with LGV, cryptitis and crypt abscesses without distortion of crypt architecture were the most common findings.</p>
<p><strong>Distinguishing LGV From Non-LGV Serovars</strong></p>
<p>Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of <em>C. trachomatis</em>-positive specimens is now used to distinguish LGV-associated serovars from oculogenital <em>C. trachomatis</em>. Sequencing, which is increasingly widely available, is the method now recommended by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) for genotyping, though various assays have been developed for this purpose. These techniques have been applied with great success on anorectal specimens collected from patients with proctitis during the recent LGV outbreaks in Western Europe.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Management</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>General Advice</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Patients should be informed that LGV is an invasive bacterial STI that is curable with antibiotics. Left untreated it can have serious and permanent adverse sequelae. </li>
    <li>Symptoms should resolve within 1 to 2 weeks of commencing antibiotic therapy. </li>
    <li>Patients should be advised to avoid unprotected sexual intercourse until they and their partners(s) have completed treatment and follow-up. </li>
    <li>Patients should be given a detailed explanation of their condition with particular emphasis on the long-term implications for the health of themselves and their partners(s). This should be reinforced by giving them clear and accurate written information. </li>
    <li>High rates of incident HIV and HCV infections have been observed in LGV-infected MSM in the recent outbreaks and may reflect ongoing inflammatory proctitis. HIV risk reduction advice and interventions should be offered to HIV-negative MSM, focusing not only on risks of unprotected anal sex but also extended to risks associated with traumatic anoreceptive practices (including fisting, sex toy use), serosorting and recreational drug use in this population. Anal enema use has been associated with LGV infection in MSM and they should be warned of possible transmission via shared equipment for rectal douching. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Further Investigations</strong></p>
<p>Screening for other possible causes of GUD should be arranged where relevant, i.e., diagnostic testing for <em>Haemophilus ducreyi</em>, <em>Treponema pallidum</em>, herpes simplex virus and<em> Klebsiella/Calymmatobacterium granulomatis</em> (see BASHH guidelines on chancroid, syphilis, genital herpes and donovanosis, respectively). <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>, syphilis and herpes can also cause proctitis and these infections should be tested for in addition to <em>C. trachomatis</em>. LGV in Europe is often associated with HIV and HCV infections and serological screening for these is therefore strongly recommended.</p>
<p>Lymph node aspiration and even biopsy of relevant lesions may be needed to distinguish LGV from atypical infections and neoplasia.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<p>No controlled, double-blind treatment trials of LGV have been published. The low incidence of the disease in industrialized nations, its complex presentation and its natural history, marked by spontaneous remissions and exacerbations, have precluded any rigorous evaluation of management. Only a single comparative trial published in 1957 demonstrated that the duration of buboes in patients receiving tetracycline, sulfadiazine or chloramphenicol was significantly shorter than in patients managed by non-specific supportive measures alone. Subsequent observations have reported the successful use of tetracycline, minocycline and rifampicin. Early treatment is important to prevent or reduce the chronic phase. Prolonged treatment (at least 3 weeks) is the norm and more than one course of therapy, alternating some of the above antibiotics, may be necessary for chronic cases.</p>
<p>On the basis of the known response of <em>C. trachomatis</em> to antibiotics such as doxycycline, tetracycline and erythromycin in uncomplicated infections, recommendations have been made and summarized in Table 1 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Regimens</strong></p>
<p><strong>1st choice</strong>: Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily orally for 21 days (or tetracycline 2 g daily or minocycline 300 mg loading dose followed by 200 mg twice daily) (<strong>IIb, III or IV, B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>2nd choice</strong>: Erythromycin 500 mg four times daily orally for 21 days (<strong>IV, B</strong>). Azithromycin 1 g weekly for 3 weeks should also be considered.</p>
<p>The rationale for longer regimens relates to the systemic nature of LGV infection. In one recent study, rectal swabs for <em>C. trachomatis</em> NAATs took up to 16 days to become negative in LGV proctitis, in contrast to non-LGV chlamydia, where DNA was undetectable after 7 days.</p>
<p>A single case of clinical failure with extended doxycycline therapy has been reported in an HIV negative MSM with LGV DNA-positive bilateral inguinal buboes and an anal ulcer. He subsequently responded to treatment with moxifloxacin 400 mg daily for 10 days; no isolate was available for resistance testing. No other treatment failures with doxycycline have been reported.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative Regimens</strong></p>
<p><em>Azithromycin</em></p>
<p>The activity of azithromycin against <em>C. trachomatis</em> suggests that it may be effective in multiple dose regimens over 2 to 3 weeks, but clinical data on its use are lacking. Several case reports of rectal LGV in MSM have shown clearance with azithromycin regimens of 1 g stat and 1 g weekly for 3 weeks (<strong>IV, C</strong>). If effective, many clinicians may prefer a multiple-dose regimen of azithromycin to erythromycin due to improved tolerability.</p>
<p>Fluoroquinolone-based therapy with active antichlamydial agents such as ofloxacin and moxifloxacin are expected to be effective in LGV infections but, apart from the above case, no reports of their use in LGV are available. A course of at least 2 weeks would be advisable if clinical necessity warranted their use (<strong>IV, C</strong>) and test of cure should be performed.</p>
<p>These recommended treatment regimens are similar to those of Centers for Disease Control (CDC) (2010) and European (2010) guidelines. The vast majority of cases during the recent LGV outbreaks were successfully treated with standard 3-week courses of doxycycline. Clearly, the current outbreaks afford the opportunity to conduct randomized comparative trials of newer/shorter drug regimens, as are used routinely in resource-poor settings (e.g., doxycycline 100 mg twice daily orally for 14 days).</p>
<p><strong>Accompanying Measures</strong></p>
<p>Fluctuant buboes should be aspirated through healthy adjacent skin and surgical incision is usually contraindicated due to risk of complications such as sinus formation. Adequate analgesia should be provided for painful LGV infections.</p>
<p><strong>Allergy</strong></p>
<p>Patients allergic to tetracyclines should be treated with either the erythromycin or the extended azithromycin regimen. Test of cure at the completion of treatment is advised.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment for Pregnant or Breastfeeding Women</strong></p>
<p>Pregnant and breastfeeding women should be treated with the erythromycin regimen. Extended azithromycin therapy might be considered in this scenario due to improved tolerability, but no published data are available to guide safety, dosing and efficacy in pregnancy. Test of cure is advised in pregnancy if rectal or genital LGV are diagnosed.</p>
<p><strong>HIV-Positive Individuals</strong></p>
<p>LGV occurs commonly in HIV-infected individuals and they should receive the same regimens as those who are HIV negative. There are few significant drug&amp;ndash;drug interactions between commonly used antiretroviral agents and doxycycline.</p>
<p><strong>Adverse Reactions to Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The most common doxycycline side effects are upper gastrointestinal problems including dyspepsia and nausea; diarrhoea is less frequent. These might be mitigated by taking doses after meals. Photosensitivity can occur, especially in climates with abundant sunshine, and patients should be warned of this and advised not to expose themselves unduly. Oesophageal ulceration can occur from prolonged doxycycline mucosal contact, especially with the capsule formulations. It is recommended that doxycycline be taken with a large glass of water and that patients not lie down for at least 20 min after swallowing the medication.</p>
<p>The most common erythromycin side effects are also gastrointestinal problems including mild diarrhoea, stomach pain, nausea and vomiting.</p>
<p><strong>Contact Tracing and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Persons who have had sexual contact with a patient who has LGV within the 4 weeks before onset of the patient's symptoms, or the last 3 months if asymptomatic LGV is detected, should be examined, tested for rectal, pharyngeal, urethral and/or cervical chlamydial infection (as applicable) and receive presumptive treatment with 21 days of doxycycline 100 mg twice daily or an alternative regimen for the same duration (<strong>IV, C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Follow-Up</strong></p>
<p>All patients should be followed clinically until signs and symptoms have resolved. This usually occurs within 1 to 2 weeks for early infection, including MSM proctitis, but may take up to 3 to 6 weeks for longstanding infections or sequelae. Some early LGV infections can be asymptomatic when first diagnosed and then might become symptomatic prior to or during the initial days of treatment; these symptoms should settle promptly. Routine test of cure for LGV is no longer considered necessary if the recommended 21-day course of doxycycline has been completed. If indicated, test of cure should be performed at 2 weeks after the completion of LGV treatment to avoid detection of nonviable <em>C. trachomatis</em> DNA/RNA (<strong>IV, C</strong>).</p>
<p>Follow-up should also check that adequate partner notification has been completed, any patient concerns have been addressed and follow-up testing for syphilis and blood-borne viruses including hepatitis B, C and HIV done where necessary. In the recent MSM LGV epidemic, incident cases of both HIV and HCV have been observed and serological testing should be offered for both infections after appropriate window periods have elapsed according to relevant local guidelines. Abnormal liver enzymes should prompt further testing for HCV RNA as HCV antibody seroconversion in HIV-positive MSM might be delayed beyond 12 months.</p>
<p>Patients with fibrotic lesions or fistulae are beyond the stage where antibiotic therapy is effective and surgical repair, including reconstructive genital surgery, often must be considered.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Guideline development is undertaken by a multi-disciplinary writing committee with membership determined in a transparent manner. The chair is chosen by the Clinical Effectiveness Group (CEG). The CEG lead then discusses with the chair what suggestions they might have for members from other disciplines. The additional members of the group are then invited by the CEG. Writing committee membership includes relevant professional groups (for example genitourinary medicine physicians, nurses, health advisors, pharmacists, microbiologists and other professionals from allied&amp;nbsp;specialities as appropriate) and when relevant this will involve working with the appropriate British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) Special Interest Group (SIG) and the BASHH audit group.</p>
<p>Patients' views and preferences are sought and considered and the process documented. This may include patient representative involvement in the writing committee, information obtained from patient interview or surveys during the writing and/or piloting process, reviewing published work on patient experiences or involving patient associations. The chair of the writing group identifies an appropriate member such as the Health Advisor to get patient feedback on the guideline. BASHH is currently developing a public panel to assist with its work and in the future this group could be approached to assist in guideline development.</p>
<p>Recommendations are formulated with consideration of their health benefits, side effects and risks, with evidence presented in the guideline that these issues have been addressed. Each recommendation is linked to the supporting evidence with a list of relevant references.</p>
<p>Consideration is given to pragmatic and organisational issues relevant to the guideline. This is sought during and may emerge from the piloting of the guideline.</p>
<p>The authors consider the financial cost implications of recommendations made. Where disagreement arises within the writing committee with regard to recommendations the chair attempts to resolve these (for example by a voting system or formal consensus method). The process is documented and reported to the CEG editor. When this is not possible the CEG will review the evidence themselves and invite the chair and possibly other members of the writing committee to a meeting to agree a resolution and final recommendations.</p></div>"/>
