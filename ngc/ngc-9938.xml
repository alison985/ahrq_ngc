	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong>Statement 1. Baseline Voice Assessment</strong></p>
<p>The surgeon should document assessment of the patient's voice once a decision has been made to proceed with thyroid surgery.</p>
<p><em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation</span> based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</em></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C </li>
    <li>Benefit: Establish a baseline, improve the detection of preexisting voice impairment, establish expectations about voice outcomes, educating the patient, facilitates shared decision making, prioritize the need for preoperative laryngeal assessment and more in-depth voice assessment </li>
    <li>Risk, harm, cost: Anxiety, cost of assessment tool, patient and provider time </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Perception by the Guideline Development Group (GDG) of a current underassessment of voice prior to surgery </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The proximity of the assessment to the day of surgery is not specified because there was no consensus among the guideline group and there were no data to support the choice of one time point over another. The group agreed that any change in voice would warrant a new assessment. </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Selection of assessment methods </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statement 2A. Preoperative Laryngeal Assessment of the Impaired Voice</strong></p>
<p>The surgeon should examine vocal fold mobility, or refer the patient to a clinician who can examine vocal fold mobility, if the patient's voice is impaired (as determined by the assessment in Statement 1) and a decision has been made to proceed with thyroid surgery.</p>
<p><em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation</span> based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</em></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C </li>
    <li>Benefit: Assess mobility of vocal fold, potential diagnosis of invasive thyroid cancer, influence the decision for surgery, extent of surgery, intraoperative technique, preoperative patient counseling, distinguish iatrogenic from disease related paralysis/paresis </li>
    <li>Risk, harm, cost: Misdiagnosis (false positive/false negative), cost of examination, patient discomfort, resources, access, anxiety </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: None </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Limited </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statement 2B. Preoperative Laryngeal Assessment of the Nonimpaired Voice</strong></p>
<p>The surgeon should examine vocal fold mobility, or refer the patient to a clinician who can examine vocal fold mobility, if the patient's voice is normal and the patient has (a) thyroid cancer with suspected extrathyroidal extension, or (b) prior neck surgery that increases the risk of laryngeal nerve injury (carotid endarterectomy, anterior approach to the cervical spine, cervical esophagectomy, and prior thyroid or parathyroid surgery), or (c) both, once a decision has been made to proceed with thyroid surgery.</p>
<p><em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation</span> based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</em></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C </li>
    <li>Benefit: Assess mobility of vocal fold, potential diagnosis of invasive thyroid cancer, influence the decision for surgery, extent of surgery, intraoperative technique, preoperative patient counseling, distinguish iatrogenic from disease related paralysis/paresis </li>
    <li>Risk, harm, cost: Misdiagnosis (false positive/false negative), cost of examination, patient discomfort, resources, access, anxiety </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Even though the prevalence of preoperative vocal fold paresis is low, the consequence of not knowing this prior to surgery could result in substantial morbidity or mortality. For this reason, the GDG was willing to accept a large number of normal examinations in return for an occasional abnormal finding. </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The timing of assessment relative to surgery is not stated to allow clinicians flexibility in decision making, although the GDG agreed that the assessment should take place as close to the surgery as possible. The word suspected is used due to the difficulty of identifying extrathyroidal extension through physical exam and imaging. </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Limited </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statement 3. Patient Education on Voice Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>The clinician should educate the patient about the potential impact of thyroid surgery on voice once a decision has been made to proceed with thyroid surgery.</p>
<p><em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation</span> based on preponderance of benefit over harm.</em></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the value of patient education in general regarding surgery; Grade C, studies on the incidence of voice impairment following thyroid surgery in particular </li>
    <li>Benefit: Facilitate shared decision making, establish realistic expectations, help patients recognize voice changes postoperatively </li>
    <li>Risk, harm, cost: Anxiety </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Generalize evidence about the benefits of patient education to this circumstance </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: None </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Patient can decline information </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statement 4. Communication With Anesthesiologist</strong></p>
<p>The surgeon should inform the anesthesiologist of the results of abnormal preoperative laryngeal assessment in patients who have had laryngoscopy prior to thyroid surgery.</p>
<p><em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation</span> based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</em></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C </li>
    <li>Benefit: Allow anesthesiologist to select proper tube, allow anesthesiologist to optimize airway management, identify potential problems with intubation and extubation, plan postoperative care and monitoring, may prevent anesthetic related voice disturbance </li>
    <li>Risk, harm, cost: None </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: The GDG felt that even though the recommendation followed best practice there was a perception the action was not universally performed. </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: Timing of discussion is not specified but should occur before the patient enters the operating room </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: None </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statement 5. Identifying Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve (RLN)</strong></p>
<p>The surgeon should identify the RLN(s)&amp;nbsp;during thyroid surgery.</p>
<p><em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Strong recommendation</span> based on a preponderance of benefit over harm.</em></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B, RCTs and retrospective cohort studies </li>
    <li>Benefit: Optimize voice outcome, protect the RLN, preserve laryngeal function, reduce incidence of RLN injury </li>
    <li>Risk, harm, cost: Inadvertent RLN injury, extended operative time, false identification of another structure as the RLN </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: None </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: None </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: None </li>
    <li>Exclusions: Thyroid surgery limited to the isthmus </li>
    <li>Policy level: Strong recommendation </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statement 6. Protection of Superior Laryngeal Nerve</strong></p>
<p>The surgeon should take steps to preserve the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve(s) when performing thyroid surgery.</p>
<p><em><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendation</span> based on preponderance of benefit over harm.</em></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C </li>
    <li>Benefit: Preserves vocal projection and high frequencies </li>
    <li>Risk, harm, cost: May leave superior pole thyroid tissue </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>

<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C </li>
    <li>Benefit: Added information regarding neurophysiologic status of the RLN (specifically when the nerve is injured), potential improved accuracy in nerve identification, potentially avoiding transient/temporary nerve </li>
    <li>Risk, harm, cost: Cost of endotracheal tube and probe; capital equipment costs; education of key personnel including anesthesia, nursing, surgeon, and technician; misinterpretation (both false positive/false negative); may instill a false sense of security in identifying nerve </li>

    <li>Risk, harm, cost: Cost of assessment tools/examinations </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: The GDG believes that postoperative voice assessment is not being performed universally, in the identified time frame. </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The documentation time is stated as between 2 weeks and 2 months because there is no evidence on the optimal time, but the GDG suggests that the evaluation should be late enough to overcome transient postoperative changes but early enough to allow effective intervention. </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: No role in documenting the outcome, but a significant role in the choice and extent of outcome assessment </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statement 10. Postoperative Laryngeal Examination</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should examine vocal fold mobility or refer the patient for examination of vocal fold mobility in patients with a change in voice following thyroid surgery (as identified in Statement 9).</p>

    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: None </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The timing of the examination is not specified but should occur expeditiously after the identification of a voice change, as identified in Statement 9. </li>

Evidence-based statements reflect both the quality of evidence and the balance of benefit and harm that is anticipated when the statement is followed. The definitions for evidence-based statements are listed in the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; and &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; fields. As much of the guideline dealt with evidence relating to diagnostic tests, the definitions for Evidence Quality for Grades of Evidence (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field) was adapted to include current recommendations from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>This guideline was developed using an explicit and transparent a priori protocol for creating actionable statements based on supporting evidence and the associated balance of benefit and harm. The guideline development panel was comprised of representatives from the fields of otolaryngology, laryngology, head and neck surgery, nursing, speech-language pathology, endocrinology, internal medicine, general surgery, anesthesiology, and consumer advocacy.</p>
<p>In a series of conference calls, the working group defined the scope and objectives of the proposed guideline. During the 12 months devoted to guideline development, the guideline development group met twice, with in-person meetings following the format previously described, using electronic decision support (BRIDGE-Wiz, Yale Center for Medical Informatics, New Haven, Connecticut) software to facilitate creating actionable recommendations and evidence profiles. Internal electronic review and feedback on each guideline draft was used to ensure accuracy of content and consistency with standardized criteria for reporting clinical practice guidelines.</p>
<p>American Academy of Otolaryngology&amp;mdash;Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) staff used the Guideline Implementability Appraisal and Extractor (GLIA) to appraise adherence of the draft guideline to methodological standards, improve clarity of recommendations, and predict potential obstacles to implementation. Guideline panel members received summary appraisals in May 2012 and modified an advanced draft of the guideline.</p></div>"/>

    <li>This guideline is intended to focus on quality improvement opportunities judged most important by the guideline development group (GDG). It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide for managing patients undergoing thyroid surgery. In this context, the purpose is to define useful actions for clinicians, regardless of discipline, to improve quality of care and voice outcomes. Conversely, the statements in this guideline are not intended to limit or restrict care provided by clinicians based on the assessment of individual patients. </li>
    <li>Guidelines are not intended to supersede professional judgment; rather, they may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinician discretion in a particular clinical circumstance. Less frequent variation in practice is expected for a &quot;strong recommendation&quot; than might be expected with&amp;nbsp;&quot;recommendation.&quot; &quot;Options&quot; offer the most opportunity for practice variability. Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that they believe will best serve their patients' interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations. They must also operate within their scope of practice and according to their training. Guidelines represent the best judgment of a team of experienced clinicians and methodologists addressing the scientific evidence for a particular topic. </li>
    <li>This clinical practice guideline is provided for information and educational purposes only. It is not intended as a sole source of guidance in managing voice outcomes after thyroid surgery. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this program of care. As medical knowledge expands and technology advances, clinical indicators and guidelines are promoted as conditional and provisional proposals of what is recommended under specific conditions, but they are not absolute. Guidelines are not mandates and do not and should not purport to be a legal standard of care. The responsible physician, in lights of all the circumstances presented by the individual patient, must determine the appropriate treatment. Adherence to these guidelines will not ensure successful patient outcomes in every situation. The American Academy of Otolaryngology&amp;mdash;Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS), Inc. emphasizes that these clinical guidelines should not be deemed to include all proper treatment decisions or methods of care, or to exclude other treatment decisions or methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Implementation Considerations</strong></p>
<p>The clinical practice guideline is published as a supplement to <em>Otolaryngology&amp;ndash;Head and Neck Surgery</em>, which will facilitate reference and distribution. A full-text version of the guideline will be accessible, free of charge, at <a href=&quot;http://www.entnet.org&quot; title=&quot;AAO-HNSF Web site&quot;>http://www.entnet.org</a>. In addition, all the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) guidelines are now available via the <em>Otolaryngology&amp;ndash;Head and Neck Surgery</em> app for smartphones and tablets. The guideline will be presented to American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery members as a miniseminar at the AAO-HNSF Annual Meeting &amp;amp; OTO EXPO. Existing brochures and publication by the AAO-HNSF will be updated to reflect the guideline's recommendations. </p>
<p>As a supplement to clinicians, an algorithm of the guideline's action statements has been provided (see Figure 5 in the original guideline document). The algorithm allows for a more rapid understanding of the guideline's logic and the sequence of the action statements. The guideline development group hopes the algorithm can be adopted as a quick reference guide to support the implementation of the guideline's recommendations.</p>
<p>To support clinicians' adoption of Key Action Statement 3 (see the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field), patient education of voice outcomes, a set of discussion points has been developed (see Table 7 in the original guideline document). The table highlights key points to be discussed with the patient both pre- and postoperatively. Specifically, the surgeon should discuss possible surgical risks and their relation to voice outcomes and any potential benefits. The guideline development group (GDG) recommends these materials can be incorporated into future educational materials.</p>
<p>To assist readers of the guideline who may be unfamiliar with the anatomy of the thyroid, several diagrams have been provided in the original guideline document. The diagrams identify the location of the thyroid gland and the position of both the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) and the recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLN).</p></div>"/>

<p>The cost of developing this guideline, including travel expenses of all panel members, was covered in full by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF). Potential conflicts of interest for all panel members in the past 5 years were compiled and distributed before the first conference call. After review and discussion of these disclosures, the panel concluded that individuals with potential conflicts could remain on the panel if they: (1) reminded the panel of potential conflicts before any related discussion, (2) recused themselves from a related discussion if asked by the panel, and (3) agreed not to discuss any aspect of the guideline with industry before publication. Lastly, panelists were reminded that conflicts of interest extend beyond financial relationships and may include personal experiences, how a participant earns a living, and the participant's previously established &quot;stake&quot; in an issue.</p>
