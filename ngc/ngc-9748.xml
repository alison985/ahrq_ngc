      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: This guideline was developed by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) Internal Clinical Guidelines Programme (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p>The following guidance is based on the best available evidence. The full version of the original guideline document gives details of the methods and the evidence used to develop the guidance.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>List of All Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Dietary Management: Children, Young People and Adults</strong></p>
<p>A specialist renal dietitian, supported by healthcare professionals with the necessary skills and competencies, should carry out a dietary assessment and give individualised information and advice on dietary phosphate management.</p>
<p>Advice on dietary phosphate management should be tailored to individual learning needs and preferences, rather than being provided through a generalised or complex multicomponent programme of delivery.</p>
<p>Give information about controlling intake of phosphate-rich foods (in particular, foods with a high phosphate content per gram of protein, as well as food and drinks with high levels of phosphate additives) to control serum phosphate, while avoiding malnutrition by maintaining a protein intake at or above the minimum recommended level. For people on dialysis, take into account possible dialysate protein losses.</p>
<p>If a nutritional supplement is needed to maintain protein intake in children and young people with hyperphosphataemia, offer a supplement with a lower phosphate content, taking into account patient preference and other nutritional requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Phosphate Binders: Children and Young People</strong></p>
<p>For children and young people, offer a calcium-based phosphate binder as the first-line phosphate binder to control serum phosphate in addition to dietary management.</p>
<p>For children and young people, if a series of serum calcium measurements shows a trend towards the age-adjusted upper limit of normal, consider a calcium-based binder in combination with sevelamer hydrochloride<sup>1</sup>, having taken into account other causes of rising calcium levels.</p>
<p>For children and young people who remain hyperphosphataemic despite adherence to a calcium-based phosphate binder, and whose serum calcium goes above the age-adjusted upper limit of normal, consider either combining with, or switching to, sevelamer hydrochloride<sup>1</sup>, having taken into account other causes of raised calcium.</p>
<p><strong>Phosphate Binders: Adults</strong></p>
<p>For adults, offer calcium acetate as the first-line phosphate binder to control serum phosphate in addition to dietary management.</p>
<p>For adults, consider calcium carbonate if calcium acetate is not tolerated or patients find it unpalatable.</p>
<p>For adults with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are not on dialysis and who are taking a calcium-based binder:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Consider switching to a non-calcium-based binder if calcium-based phosphate binders are not tolerated </li>
    <li>Consider either combining with, or switching to, a non-calcium-based binder if hypercalcaemia develops (having taken into account other causes of raised calcium), or if serum parathyroid hormone levels are low </li>
</ul>
<p>For adults with stage 5 CKD who are on dialysis and remain hyperphosphataemic despite adherence to the maximum recommended or tolerated dose of calcium-based phosphate binder, consider either combining with, or switching to, a non-calcium-based binder.</p>
<p>For adults with stage 5 CKD who are on dialysis and who are taking a calcium-based binder, if serum phosphate is controlled by the current diet and phosphate binder regimen but:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Serum calcium goes above the upper limit of normal, <strong>or</strong> </li>
    <li>Serum parathyroid hormone levels are low </li>
</ul>
<p>Consider either combining with, or switching to, sevelamer hydrochloride or lanthanum carbonate, having taken into account other causes of raised calcium.</p>
<p><strong>Phosphate Binders: Children, Young People and Adults</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>If a combination of phosphate binders is used, titrate the dosage to achieve control of serum phosphate while taking into account the effect of any calcium-based binders used on serum calcium levels (also see recommendations above in the sections Phosphate Binders: Children and Young People and Phosphate Binders: Adults). </li>
    <li>Take into account patient preference and the ease of administration, as well as the clinical circumstances, when offering a phosphate binder in line with recommendations listed in the above sections Phosphate Binders: Children and Young People and Phosphate Binders: Adults. </li>
    <li>Advise patients (or, as appropriate, their parents and/or carers) that it is necessary to take phosphate binders with food to control serum phosphate. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Review of Treatments: Children, Young People and Adults</strong></p>
<p>At every routine clinical review, assess the patient's serum phosphate control, taking into account:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Dietary phosphate management </li>
    <li>Phosphate binder regimen </li>
    <li>Adherence to diet and medication </li>
    <li>Other factors that influence phosphate control, such as vitamin D or dialysis </li>
</ul>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>1</sup> Although this use is common in UK clinical practice, at the time of publication (March 2013), sevelamer hydrochloride did not have a UK marketing authorisation for use in children for this indication. The prescriber should follow relevant professional guidance, taking full responsibility for the decision. The patient should provide informed consent, which should be documented.

<p><strong>Search Strategies</strong></p>
<p>The evidence reviews used to develop the guideline recommendations were underpinned by systematic literature searches, following the methods described in &quot;The Guidelines Manual&quot; (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). The aim of the systematic searches was to comprehensively identify the published evidence to answer the review questions developed by the Guideline Development Group and Short Clinical Guidelines Technical Team.</p>
<p>The search strategies for the review questions were developed by the Information Services Team with advice from the Short Clinical Guidelines Technical Team. Structured questions were developed using the PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) model and translated into search strategies using subject heading and free text terms. The strategies were run across a number of databases with no date restrictions imposed on the searches.</p>

<p><strong>Forming and Running the Short Clinical Guideline Development Group (GDG)</strong></p>
<p>Each short clinical guideline is developed by a unique GDG consisting of 10&amp;ndash;12 members, supported by the Short Clinical Guidelines Team. Each GDG has a Chair, healthcare professional members and a minimum of two patient and carer members. Co-opted expert advisers are recruited, as appropriate. A Clinical Adviser, who has specific content expertise and additional responsibilities, may also be appointed depending on the topic. Recruitment of the GDG Chair and members is carried out in accordance with NICE's policy.</p>
<p>The GDG makes its decisions using the best available evidence presented to it at GDG meetings by the Short Clinical Guidelines Team. The use of formal consensus methods within the GDG will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p><strong>Developing Review Questions</strong></p>
<p>A short clinical guideline has a narrow scope and covers only part of a care pathway. It addresses a maximum of three subject areas covering clinical management. This will result in a small number of key clinical issues. These are broken down into a defined number of review questions &amp;mdash; usually one or two per clinical management area. The exact number will be dictated by the size of the short clinical guideline remit and the amount of development time available.</p>
<p><strong>Creating Guideline Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Explicit methods of linking the evidence to recommendations are used for short clinical guidelines if the topic is suitable. This involves using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.</p>
<p>Research recommendations are formulated for short clinical guidelines. Their number is dependent on the size of the short clinical guideline remit and the amount of development time available.</p>
<p><strong>Writing the Guideline</strong></p>
<p>There are usually three versions of short clinical guidelines:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The full guideline &amp;ndash; all the recommendations, details of how they were developed and summaries of the evidence they are based on. </li>
    <li>The quick reference guide &amp;ndash; a summary of the recommendations for healthcare professionals. </li>
    <li>'Understanding NICE guidance' &amp;ndash; a summary for patients and carers </li>
</ul>
<p>The full guideline is written by the Short Clinical Guidelines Team, following the principles in Chapters 9 and 10 of 'The guidelines manual' (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Interventions that Must (or Must Not) Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The Guideline Development Group (GDG) usually uses 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally must (or 'must not') is used if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions that Should (or Should Not) Be Used &amp;ndash; a 'Strong' Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'offer' (and similar words such as<strong> '</strong>refer' or 'advise') when they are confident that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost effective. The GDG uses similar forms of words (for example, 'Do not offer'&amp;hellip;) when they are confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions that Could Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'consider' when they are confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.</p></div>"/>

    <field fieldid="148" ordby="565" id="417" name="Cost Analysis" type="text">
      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Methods for obtaining cost estimates in the health economic analysis were in accordance with &quot;The Guidelines Manual&quot; (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong>Decision Problems</strong></p>
<p>Two questions were addressed, based on the literature that had been identified in the review of clinical effectiveness evidence:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>For adults with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis, which phosphate binder(s) provide cost-effective first-line management of hyperphosphataemia and its associated outcomes? </li>
    <li>For adults with stage 5 CKD on dialysis, what is the cost effectiveness of various sequences of phosphate binders in the management of hyperphosphataemia? </li>
</ul>
<p>Both questions were explored using the same model structure and, as far as the underlying simulation of hyperphosphataemia in CKD stages 4 and 5 was concerned, the same model parameters.</p>
<p>To explore the economic consequences of phosphate binders (first-line and sequential use) for the management of hyperphosphataemia, a cost&amp;ndash;utility analysis was performed, estimating expected costs and benefits (in terms of quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) for each comparator.</p>
<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<p>The model used an individual patient ('discrete event') simulation approach, capturing costs and effects associated with a series of discrete health states. Discrete-event simulation was considered to be the most appropriate structure for the analysis because of the complex relationships between biochemical intermediate outcomes (such as blood phosphate and calcium concentrations) and long-term, patient-relevant outcomes such as cardiovascular events, fractures and death.</p>

    <li>This guidance represents the view of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), which was arrived at after careful consideration of the evidence available. Healthcare professionals are expected to take it fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement. However, the guidance does not override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or guardian or carer, and informed by the summary of product characteristics of any drugs they are considering. </li>
    <li>Implementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local commissioners and/or providers. Commissioners and providers are reminded that it is their responsibility to implement the guidance, in their local context, in light of their duties to avoid unlawful discrimination and to have regard to promoting equality of opportunity. Nothing in this guidance should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with compliance with those duties. </li>
    <li>The guideline will assume that prescribers will use a drug's summary of product characteristics to inform decisions made with individual patients. </li>
    <li>Patients and healthcare professionals have rights and responsibilities as set out in the National Health Service Constitution for England &amp;ndash; all NICE guidance is written to reflect these. Treatment and care should take into account individual needs and preferences. Patients should have the opportunity to make informed decisions about their care and treatment, in partnership with their healthcare professionals. If someone does not have the capacity to make decisions, healthcare professionals should follow the Department of Health's advice on consent, the code of practice that accompanies the Mental Capacity Act and the supplementary code of practice on deprivation of liberty safeguards. In Wales, healthcare professionals should follow advice on consent from the Welsh Government. </li>
    <li>This guideline recommends some drugs for indications for which they do not have a UK marketing authorisation at the date of publication, if there is good evidence to support that use. The prescriber should follow relevant professional guidance, taking full responsibility for the decision. The patient (or those with authority to give consent on their behalf) should provide informed consent, which should be documented. See the General Medical Council's Good practice in prescribing and managing medicines and devices for further information. Where recommendations have been made for the use of drugs outside their licensed indications ('off-label use'), these drugs are marked with a footnote in the recommendations. </li>
    <li>For all recommendations, NICE expects that there is discussion with the patient about the risks and benefits of the interventions, and their values and preferences. This discussion aims to help them to reach a fully informed decision. </li>
