<p>In the absence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chemotherapy with no treatment controls for inoperable, recurrent, or metastatic leiomyosarcoma (LMS) of the uterus, the Sarcoma Disease Site Group (DSG) and Gynecologic Cancer DSG offer the following recommendations:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Doxorubicin alone or gemcitabine alone or gemcitabine plus docetaxel may be treatment options as first and/or second line therapy for women with inoperable, locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic uterine LMS, based on current available evidence from the medical literature (four single-arm phase II studies, one arm of an RCT, and one abstract).
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Hematological toxicity is common and should be monitored, and granulocyte growth factor (G-CSF) should be considered when gemcitabine plus docetaxel is used. </li>
        <li>Other toxicities, such as neurotoxicity, pulmonary or cardiovascular toxicity, should be monitored. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Literature Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p>In 2004, Program in Evidence-based Care (PEBC) and the Gynecologic Cancer Disease Site Group (DSG) developed a guideline on systemic therapy for advanced, recurrent, or metastatic uterine sarcoma by searching the literature from 1980 to June 2004. This 2004 systematic review was used as the basis for this new updated review. Because the 2005 guideline included studies pertaining to all types of uterine sarcoma, only those that met the study selection criteria of this new guideline were eligible for inclusion in this review.</p>
<p>To update the 2004 systematic review, a literature search was performed using MEDLINE and EMBASE through the Ovid search engine from January 1, 2004, to June 17, 2011 to find eligible full texts. The search strategies are reported in Appendices 2 and 3 of the original guideline document. The following resources were checked for existing systematic reviews and practice guidelines, based on a systematic review: the Cochrane Library (to Issue 6, 2011), National Guideline Clearinghouse, National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia), New Zealand Guidelines Group, American Society of Care Oncology, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, Scottish Intercollegiate guidelines Network, Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, and Gynecologic Oncology Group (to June 16, 2011); and the Standards and Guidelines Evidence Inventory of Cancer Guidelines, which included over 1100 English-language cancer control guidelines and standards released from 2003 through June 2010 when it was checked on June 2, 2011.</p>
<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting Abstracts from 2005 to 2011 and Connective Tissue Oncology Society (CTOS) Annual Meeting Abstracts from 2005 to 2010 were checked for eligible abstracts.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Study Selection Criteria</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Inclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Articles or abstracts were eligible for inclusion in this systematic review if they met all of the following criteria:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Full text reports were published from January 1, 2004, to June 17, 2011 or abstracts were published from January 1, 2005, to July 7, 2011. </li>
    <li>Full text reports were systematic reviews, clinical practice guidelines based on a systematic review, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), or prospective studies; or published abstracts that were RCTs that investigated the effect of either gemcitabine, doxorubicin, or trabectedin alone, or in a combination of gemcitabine plus docetaxel. </li>
    <li>Full text reports or abstracts reported at least one of the following clinical outcomes: tumour response rate, overall survival (OS), toxicity, progression-free survival (PFS), or quality of life (QOL) in women with inoperable, locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic uterine&amp;nbsp;leiomyosarcoma (LMS). </li>
    <li>Studies reported at least one relevant outcome on 20 or more target patients. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Articles or abstracts were excluded if they met any of the following criteria:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Full text reports or abstracts were published in a language other than English. </li>
    <li>They were non-systematic reviews, animal studies, letters, editorials, or commentaries. </li>
    <li>Studies enrolled uterine LMS patients and other types of sarcoma patients but did not report any relevant outcome separately for uterine LMS patients. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<p>The Evidence-based Series (EBS) guidelines developed by the Program in Evidence-based Care (PEBC) use the methods of the Practice Guidelines Development Cycle. For this project, the core methodology used to develop the evidentiary base was the systematic review. Evidence was selected and reviewed by the Working Group, which included three Disease Site Group (DSG) members and one methodologist from the PEBC (see Appendix 1 in the original guideline document). All data were audited by a second, independent auditor. The available medical literature evidence forms the basis of the recommendations developed by the Sarcoma DSG and the Gynecology Cancer DSG, which are published in Section 1 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Development and Internal Review</strong></p>
<p>This EBS was developed by the Sarcoma and Gynecology DSGs of the Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) PEBC. The series is a convenient and up-to-date source of the best available evidence on chemotherapy (i.e., gemcitabine, docetaxel plus gemcitabine, doxorubicin, or trabectedin) for inoperable, locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic uterine leiomyosarcoma, developed through a review of the evidentiary base, evidence synthesis, and input from external review participants in Ontario.</p></div>"/>

<p>Prior to the submission of this Evidence-Based Series (EBS) draft report for external review, the report was reviewed and approved by the Program in Evidence-based Care (PEBC) Report Approval Panel (RAP), which consists of three members, including two oncologists, with expertise in clinical and methodology issues, and a methodologist.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>External Review by Ontario Clinicians and Other Experts</span></strong></p>
<p>The PEBC external review process is two pronged and includes a targeted peer review intended to obtain direct feedback on the draft report from a small number of specified content experts and a professional consultation intended to facilitate dissemination of the final guidance report to Ontario practitioners.</p>
<p>Following the review and discussion of Section 1: Guideline Recommendations and Section 2: Evidentiary Base of this EBS and the review and approval of the report by the PEBC Report Approval Panel, the guideline authors circulated Sections 1 and 2 to external review participants for review and feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<p><em>Targeted Peer Review</em></p>
<p>During the guideline development process, 10 targeted peer reviewers from North America considered to be clinical and/or methodological experts on the topic were identified by the guideline authors. Several weeks prior to completion of the draft report, the nominees were contacted by email and asked to serve as reviewers. Three reviewers agreed, and the draft report and a questionnaire were sent via email for their review. The questionnaire consisted of items evaluating the methods, results, and interpretive summary used to inform the draft recommendations and whether the draft recommendations should be approved as a guideline. Written comments were invited. The questionnaire and draft document were sent out on March 23, 2012. Follow-up reminders were sent at two weeks and at four weeks. All the targeted peer reviewers were required to complete the conflict of interest form.</p>
<p><em>Professional Consultation</em></p>
<p>65 potential participants were identified by the guideline authors. Feedback was obtained through a brief online survey of health care professionals who are the intended users of the guideline. Participants were asked to rate the overall quality of the guideline (Section 1) and whether they would use and/or recommend it. Written comments were invited. Participants were contacted by email and directed to the survey website where they were provided with access to the survey, the guideline recommendations (Section 1) and the evidentiary base (Section 2). The notification email was sent on March 23, 2012. Two follow-up reminders were sent on April 9 and April 23, 2012.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Conclusion</span></strong></p>
<p>This EBS report reflects the integration of feedback obtained through the external review process with final approval given by the Sarcoma Disease Site Group (DSG), the Gynecology Cancer DSG, and the Working Group.</p></div>"/>
