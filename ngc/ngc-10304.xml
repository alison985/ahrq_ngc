	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

ArchiveBot's source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot">https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot</a>.

<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>FU, fluorouracil; PDT, photodynamic therapy</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>1, probably treatment of choice; 2, generally good choice; 3, generally fair choice; 4, reasonable but not usually required; 5, generally poor choice; 6, probably should not be used; &amp;ndash;, insufficient evidence available.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>a</sup>Refers to the clinician's perceived potential for good or poor healing at the affected site.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>b</sup>Does not have a product license for SCC <em>in situ</em>.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>c</sup>Consider micrographic surgery for tissue sparing or if poorly defined or recurrent.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Treatments</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>No Treatment (Strength of Recommendation D [Good Practice Point]; Level of Evidence 4)</strong></p>
<p>In some patients with slowly progressive thin lesions, especially on the lower leg of elderly patients where healing is poor, there is an argument for observation rather than intervention. In these cases use of an emollient (especially one containing urea) can reduce the scaling and make it less obvious (see Appendix 1 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) (Strength of Recommendation B; Level of Evidence 1+)</strong></p>
<p>Topically applied 5-FU is a well-recognized treatment option for SCC <em>in situ</em> and is commercially available in the U.K. as a 5% cream. Many of the original studies were performed using different concentrations and various regimens. The typical regimen in current clinical use is once- or twice-daily application for 3 to 4 weeks, repeated if required.</p>
<p><strong>Imiquimod (Strength of Recommendation B; Level of Evidence 1+)</strong></p>
<p>Imiquimod stimulates both the innate and acquired immune systems, resulting in antitumour and antiviral activity. It is available as a topical 5% cream and has been used to treat SCC <em>in situ</em>, although its licence in the U.K. is only for superficial basal cell carcinoma (BCC), actinic keratoses and genital warts. It is generally well tolerated, but it does cause significant erythema and crusting, so appropriate counselling needs to be given prior to treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Cryotherapy (Strength of Recommendation B; Level of Evidence 1+)</strong></p>
<p>Cryotherapy is a simple, inexpensive and quick method of treating SCC <em>in situ</em>, with the advantage of accessibility in the outpatient setting. Clearance rates for cryotherapy vary widely, probably reflecting differences in the techniques and regimens used, with failure rates in the order of 5% to 10% in the larger series, provided that adequate cryotherapy is used (e.g., liquid nitrogen cryotherapy, using a single freeze&amp;ndash;thaw cycle [FTC] of 30 s, two FTCs of 20 s with a thaw period, or up to three single treatments of 20 s at intervals of several weeks). However, such doses do cause discomfort and may cause ulceration, especially on the lower leg.</p>
<p><strong>Curettage with Cautery/Electrocautery (Strength of Recommendation C; Level of Evidence 2+)</strong></p>
<p>Curettage and cautery has been advocated as one of the simplest, least expensive, safest and most effective methods of dealing with SCC <em>in situ</em>, but its success is determined by the skill of the operator.</p>
<p><strong>Excision (Strength of Recommendation C; Level of Evidence 2+)</strong></p>
<p>This is a simple, rapid and effective treatment for SCC <em>in situ</em> of limited size and located in suitable areas. It allows for verification of the diagnosis and confirmation of the intraepithelial nature of the lesion. Cosmetic outcome, body site, healing properties and vascularity of the area need to be considered.</p>
<p>While it is logical that excision should be an effective treatment, the evidence base is limited. Additionally, lower-leg excision wounds may be associated with considerable morbidity.</p>
<p><em>Mohs Micrographic Surgery</em> <strong>(Strength of Recommendation D; Level of Evidence 3)</strong></p>
<p>Mohs micrographic surgery may be indicated for digital SCC <em>in situ</em> (around the nail in particular) and for some cases of genital (especially penile) SCC <em>in situ</em> for its tissue-sparing benefits. There may also be a role for Mohs in recurrent or incompletely excised lesions.</p>
<p><strong>Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) (Strength of Recommendation A; Level of Evidence 1++)</strong></p>
<p>PDT for SCC <em>in situ</em> involves topical application of the photosensitizer prodrug aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) or its more lipophilic methyl ester methyl aminolaevulinate (MAL). MAL is applied under occlusion for 3 h followed by illumination using red light, with narrowband light-emitting diode (LED) sources in routine use. Treatment is repeated 7 days later and again after 3 months, if required. Several protocols have been described for ALA-PDT in SCC <em>in situ</em> as outlined in the original guideline document, with nonformulary ALA often used. Fluorescence diagnosis, the identification of lesions using the fluorescence detectable after MAL/ALA occlusion, achieved 100% sensitivity (higher than clinical evaluation alone) and a specificity of 85.7% in a recent study in SCC <em>in situ</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Radiotherapy (Strength of Recommendation D; Level of Evidence 2+)</strong></p>
<p>Various radiotherapy techniques have been used to treat SCC <em>in situ</em>, with no standardized protocol, and a recent literature review concluded that both high- and low-dose regimens appear equally efficacious. Disadvantages include cost, patient inconvenience and poor healing, particularly on the leg. Advantages are that it can be used to treat areas where surgical modalities are difficult, and it can be used even on the scalp.</p>
<p><strong>Laser (Strength of Recommendation D; Level of Evidence 3)</strong></p>
<p>Experience of laser for SCC <em>in situ</em> is restricted largely to case reports and small series; it is considered for potentially more challenging treatment sites including the digits and genitalia.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Therapy costs will vary depending on the location of services, staffing, volume of procedures and local protocols (e.g., frequency of biopsies prior to nonsurgical therapies).</p>
<p>A cost-minimization analysis based on costs incurred by the U.K. National Health Service (NHS) was published in 2003, comparing cryotherapy, curettage and cautery, excision, laser ablation, photodynamic therapy (PDT) and topical 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) <em>in situ</em>. Assumptions included the expectation of diagnostic biopsy in all cases managed by nonsurgical options. Cryotherapy was costed at three visits to achieve clearance, while PDT was costed on two treatments. Curettage or excision biopsy were the cheapest treatments (&amp;pound;200), followed by 5-FU (&amp;pound;287), laser (&amp;pound;312) then cryotherapy (&amp;pound;392), with PDT being the most expensive (&amp;pound;457), although this was costed on more expensive light sources than in current use. This did not include the costs of complications or costs incurred by the patient or their relatives. A cost comparison based on published clearance/morbidity data (excluding the cost of a diagnostic biopsy) estimated the cost of successfully treating a single SCC <em>in situ</em> to be &amp;pound;119 for PDT, &amp;pound;145 for cryotherapy and &amp;pound;171 for 5-FU, which included additional clinic visits to manage complications.</p>
<p>In one small, retrospective study from Spain, of lesions located on the lower limbs, surgical excision of SCC <em>in situ</em> (n=54) and superficial basal cell carcinoma (sBCC) (n=32) provided high cure rates, but was more expensive than nonsurgical modalities following calculation of the total medical cost, as well as direct and indirect costs. This study was costed on currently licensed methyl aminolaevulinate (MAL)-PDT, compared with earlier studies that costed aminolaevulinic acid (ALA)-PDT. After 2 years of follow-up, a complete response was observed in 89.5 % of the PDT group, 87.5% of the imiquimod group and 97.5% of the surgery group, but the average total cost for each treated tumour was &amp;euro;536 for surgery, &amp;euro;214 for PDT and &amp;euro;229 for imiquimod. Even allowing for reduced efficacy of the topical therapies, the cost per complete response was also lower with PDT and imiquimod than with surgery. In view of variations in drug pricing as well as service delivery, costings will vary between countries.</p>
<p>In the absence of new therapies, and with limited variation in treatment recommendations since the last guideline update, there should be no significant organizational or financial barriers to the treatment recommendations contained in this guideline. Cost pressures are most likely from increased prevalence of the condition and organizational changes impacting the availability of hospital-delivered therapies.</p></div>"/>

    <li>Disadvantages of radiotherapy include patient inconvenience and poor healing, particularly on the leg.
