	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

    <field fieldid="151" ordby="310" id="421" name="Major Recommendations" type="text">
      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The Alberta Provincial Cutaneous Tumour Team endorses the strategies described in the <em>Snapshot of Skin Cancer Prevention Facts and Figures: A Resource to Guide Skin Cancer Prevention in Alberta</em> (see the &quot;Adaptation&quot; field), developed by the Health Protection Unit (Alberta Health Services, Population and Public Health).</p>
<p>Described briefly is an adaptation of the key recommendations:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li><strong>Counseling in the healthcare setting</strong>. The emphasis of counseling should be on children, adolescents, and young adults for whom there is the most evidence of success and who are at the highest risk of developing skin cancer (see the &quot;Target Population&quot; field) about minimizing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation to reduce the risk of skin cancer. Current evidence is insufficient to recommend counseling adults older than age 24 years about minimizing UV radiation exposure to prevent skin cancer. Counseling should include the following:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li><strong>Limit sun exposure</strong>.
        <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
            <li>Limit time in the midday sun (typically between 10 am and 4 pm) or when the sun is at its highest (Environment Canada, 2013). </li>
            <li>Use shade wisely (when UV rays are the most intense), but remember that shade structures such as trees, umbrellas or canopies do not offer complete sun protection. Exposure to UV rays reflected on snow, water, and concrete should be avoided. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Wear protective clothing</strong>.
        <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
            <li>Wear a wide brim (&amp;gt;7.5 cm) hat to protect eyes, ears, face, and back of neck. </li>
            <li>Use sunglasses that provide 99% to 100% UV-A/B protection to protect eyes. </li>
            <li>Wear tightly woven, loose fitting clothes that cover as much of the body as possible; if possible, clothing with an ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) is optimal. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Use sunscreen and protective lip balm</strong>.
        <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
            <li>Use a broad spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30. </li>
            <li>Apply liberally to ensure adequate protection; higher SPF sunscreens are best. </li>
            <li>Reapply often:
            <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
                <li>Every two hours or more often if swimming, toweling, or perspiring heavily </li>
                <li>Immediately after swimming, toweling, or heavy perspiration </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Avoid indoor tanning (tanning beds and sun lamps)</strong>. </li>
        <li><strong>Protect children and teens</strong>.
        <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
            <li>Babies younger than six months of age should be kept out of direct sunlight and protected from the sun using hats and protective clothing. </li>
            <li>Children should be provided with sun protection for outdoor activities; use sunscreen on children six months of age or older. </li>
            <li>Parents should counsel teens about the dangers of UV over-exposure and discourage them from using indoor tanning equipment. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Get vitamin D safely</strong>. Use vitamin D supplements and consume vitamin D fortified foods. Specifically, physicians and health care workers should not recommend tanning beds for vitamin D supplementation. </li>
        <li><strong>Examine the skin</strong>. Regular examination of the skin will allow an individual to become familiar with his skin and become more likely to notice any changes. Changes to look for include an unusual lesion or a lesion that had changed. Prompt assessment and early referral to a dermatologist is recommended for suspicious pigmented lesions. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Population-based interventions that limit UV exposure</strong>. The literature suggests that the most effective interventions for reducing UV exposure are multifaceted and often have a follow-up component or multiple opportunities for interaction with participants. Therefore, combining these interventions may generate greater success than any one intervention can achieve alone.
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li><strong>Legislation to restrict the use of indoor tanning and to ban retail displays, advertising and promotion of indoor tanning</strong>. Legislation aimed at adolescents should consider both the stringency of the laws (i.e., parental consent versus age group ban for youth restrictions) and the enforcement of the laws (i.e., frequency of local inspections). </li>
        <li><strong>Policies on the use of sun protection in high risk settings</strong>. School policies enforcing the use of sun protection are just one component of a larger community-wide, multi-component strategy to address sun exposure in children. There is limited evidence on the effectiveness of sun protection policies for outdoor workers. </li>
        <li><strong>Social marketing and mass media campaigns</strong>. Carefully planned campaigns designed to build public awareness of skin cancer and increase engagement from the community have been shown to change attitudes, beliefs, knowledge and behavior around UV exposure, with a trending decrease in skin cancer incidence.
        <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
            <li>Promotional efforts that utilize television advertising, radio, public service announcements, outdoor billboard advertising, transit advertising (bus sides), print advertisements, and the Internet can be considered. </li>
            <li>Media campaigns involving an appearance-focused intervention such as UV photography that demonstrate cumulative skin damage in real time could be considered. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Education on sun protection</strong>. In the workplace setting, training and education for employees, as well as the provision of sun protection equipment may help to improve sun safety practices. Educational, curriculum-based programs in elementary schools that take place over several years have been shown to be effective. </li>

<p>Specific research questions to be addressed by the guideline document were formulated by the guideline lead(s) and Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist using the PICO question format (patient or population, intervention, comparisons, outcomes).</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Questions</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Who is most at risk and, therefore, most likely to benefit from sun protection strategies? </li>
    <li>What counseling should healthcare providers offer to high-risk individuals regarding ultraviolet (UV) exposure? </li>
    <li>What types of interventions are effective in limiting UV exposure to high-risk individuals? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases were searched for primary literature on skin cancer prevention. In addition, the following grey literature sources were also searched: Google Scholar, World Health Organization, the Directory of Open Access Repositories (OpenDOAR), OAISter, Turning Research Into Practice (TRIP) Database, Health Sciences Online, Health Canada, and Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>The search strategy for literature on counseling in the primary care setting for patients regarding UV exposure included the search terms: primary care AND (counseling OR counselling) AND (UV exposure OR ultraviolet light exposure) AND (melanoma OR skin cancer); primary care AND (counseling OR counselling) AND (UV exposure OR ultraviolet light exposure) AND (risk* OR risk factor*). Publications included in this review were limited to systematic reviews and guidelines and totaled eight publications.</p>
<p>The search strategy for literature on interventions for the general population included the search terms: (melanoma or skin cancer) AND (policy OR policies); (melanoma or skin cancer) AND (policy OR policies) AND prevent*; (melanoma or skin cancer) AND (policy OR policies) and sun protection. Non-English publications were excluded from the search; otherwise, any publications describing interventions intended to decrease UV exposure were included if they reported on outcomes related to UV exposure or rates of skin cancer. A total of 20 publications were included in the review.</p>
<p>The search strategy for literature on interventions for specific high-risk groups included the search terms (<em>counseling</em> OR <em>policy</em> OR <em>policies</em> OR <em>social marketing</em>) AND (<em>melanoma</em> OR <em>skin cancer</em>) combined with each of the following: (1) (<em>first-degree relative</em>* OR <em>hereditary</em>); (2) (<em>pediatric</em> OR <em>child</em>*); (3) (<em>outdoor worker</em>* OR <em>exposure</em> OR <em>occupational exposure</em>); (4) (<em>immunosuppressed</em> OR <em>immune deficien</em>*); (5) (<em>freckles</em> OR <em>lentigo</em>); and (6) (<em>indoor tanning</em> OR <em>tanning bed</em>* OR <em>tanning salon</em>*). Non-English publications were excluded from the search; otherwise, any publications describing interventions intended to decrease UV exposure were included if they reported on outcomes related to UV exposure or rates of skin cancer.

A detailed description of the methodology used to develop the guideline can be found in the GURU Handbook (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Tables</strong></p>
<p>Evidence tables containing the first author, year of publication, patient group/stage of disease, methodology, and main outcomes of interest are assembled using the studies identified in the literature search. Existing guidelines on the topic are assessed by the KM Specialist using portions of the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument (<a href=&quot;http://www.agreetrust.org&quot; title=&quot;AGREE Trust Web site&quot;>http://www.agreetrust.org</a>) and those meeting the minimum requirements are included in the evidence document. Due to limited resources, GURU does not regularly employ the use of multiple reviewers to rank the level of evidence; rather, the methodology portion of the evidence table contains the pertinent information required for the reader to judge for himself the quality of the studies.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Formulating Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The working group members formulated the guideline recommendations based on the evidence synthesized by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist during the planning process, blended with expert clinical interpretation of the evidence. As detailed in the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit Handbook (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field), the working group members may decide to adopt the recommendations of another institution without any revisions, adapt the recommendations of another institution or institutions to better reflect local practices, or develop their own set of recommendations by adapting some, but not all, recommendations from different guidelines.</p>
<p>The degree to which a recommendation is based on expert opinion of the working group and/or the Provincial Tumour Team members is explicitly stated in the guideline recommendations. Similar to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) methodology for formulating guideline recommendations, the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU) does not use formal rating schemes for describing the strength of the recommendations, but rather describes, in conventional and explicit language, the type and quality of the research and existing guidelines that were taken into consideration when formulating the recommendations.</p></div>"/>

<p>When the draft guideline document has been completed, revised, and reviewed by the Knowledge Management Specialist and the working group members, it is sent to all members of the Provincial Tumour Team for review and comment. This step ensures that those intended to use the guideline have the opportunity to review the document and identify potential difficulties for implementation before the guideline is finalized. Depending on the size of the document, and the number of people it is sent to for review, a deadline of one to two weeks will usually be given to submit any feedback. Ideally, this review will occur prior to the annual Provincial Tumour Team meeting, and a discussion of the proposed edits will take place at the meeting. The working group members will then make final revisions to the document based on the received feedback, as appropriate. Once the guideline is finalized, it will be officially endorsed by the Provincial Tumour Team Lead and the Executive Director of Provincial Tumour Programs.</p></div>"/>
