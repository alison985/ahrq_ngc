	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p>The grades of recommendations (A-D) and levels of evidence (1++, 1+, 1-, 2++, 2+, 2-, 3, 4) are defined at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Smoking</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Advise patients to stop smoking as soon as the diagnosis of lung cancer is suspected and explain the benefits of doing so.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Inform patients that smoking increases the risk of pulmonary complications.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Do not postpone surgery for lung cancer to allow patients to stop smoking.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Diagnostic Investigations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaging</strong></p>
<p><em>Chest X-Ray</em></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - A chest X-ray should be performed on all patients being investigated for the possibility of lung cancer.</p>
<p><em>Computed Tomography (CT) Scanning</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Contrast enhanced CT scanning of the chest and abdomen is recommended in all patients with suspected lung cancer, regardless of chest X-ray results.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - A tissue diagnosis should not be inferred from CT appearances alone.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Contrast enhanced CT scanning of the chest and abdomen should be performed prior to further diagnostic investigations, including bronchoscopy, and the results used to guide the investigation that is most likely to provide both a diagnosis and stage the disease to the highest level.</p>
<p><em>Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT) Scanning</em></p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET-CT scanning may be used to investigate patients presenting with solitary lung lesions but histological/cytological confirmation of results will still be required.</p>
<p><strong>Bronchoscopy</strong></p>
<p><em>Central Tumors</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Patients with central lesions who are otherwise fit should undergo flexible bronchoscopy in order to establish a histological or cytological diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Visible tumours should be sampled using more than one technique to optimise sensitivity.</p>
<p><em>Peripheral Tumors</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Bronchoscopy may provide a diagnosis for peripheral lesions, although percutaneous fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is the preferred approach.</p>
<p><strong>Percutaneous FNA Biopsy</strong></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Percutaneous FNA biopsy should be considered as the preferred diagnostic technique in patients with peripheral lesions.</p>
<p><strong>Sputum Cytology</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Sputum cytology should only be used in patients with large central lesions, where bronchoscopy or other diagnostic tests are deemed unsafe.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Bronchoscopic Techniques</strong></p>
<p><em>Peripheral Lung Lesions</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - The use of advanced bronchoscopic techniques should be considered in patients with tumours where sampling with traditional approaches has failed to provide suitable diagnostic material.</p>
<p><strong>Video-Assisted Thoracoscopy (VATS)</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Thoracoscopy should be considered for patients with pleural effusions or peripheral lesions where less invasive means have not achieved histological and cytological confirmation of diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong>Applicability of Cytological Samples for Optimal Assessment</strong></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Cytology samples can be used to provide material suitable for both non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subtyping and some molecular analysis, provided the samples are appropriately handled and processed.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Staging Investigations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>T-Stage in NSCLC</strong></p>
<p><em>CT Scanning</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Patients with suspected T3 or T4 disease who are otherwise fit for surgery should not be denied surgical exploration on the basis of a CT scan alone.</p>
<p><em>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scanning</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - MRI is not recommended in the routine assessment of the T stage except in patients with superior sulcus tumours. It may be of value in selected patients with suspected mediastinal invasion.</p>
<p><em>Thoracoscopy</em></p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - Thoracoscopy may be considered for more accurate determination of the T stage in patients with suspected mediastinal or chest wall invasion when less invasive techniques have been inconclusive.</p>
<p><strong>N Stage in NSCLC</strong></p>
<p><em>CT Scanning of Mediastinal Nodes (N2/3)</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - A positive CT scan result for mediastinal lymphadenopathy (&amp;gt;10 mm in short axis diameter) indicates the need for pathological sampling of the enlarged nodes (with the exception of extensive infiltrating disease) if clinically indicated.</p>
<p><em>MRI Scanning of Mediastinal Nodes (N2/3)</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - MRI has no role in the routine staging of mediastinal lymphadenopathy.</p>
<p><em>PET Scanning of Mediastinal Nodes (N2/3)</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - All patients with NSCLC who are being considered for radical treatment should have a staging FDG PET-CT scan before treatment.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Patients with a negative FDG PET-CT scan result of mediastinal nodes of 10 mm or less in short axis on CT scanning could proceed to radical treatment.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Histological confirmation of mediastinal nodes should be considered if nodes are &amp;gt;10 mm in short axis diameter on CT or nodes are positive on PET-CT scanning.</p>
<p><em>Neck Ultrasonography FNA</em></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Neck ultrasound FNA should be considered for a pathological diagnosis and staging in the case of a positive supraclavicular node on clinical examination, by CT or PET-CT scanning.</p>
<p><em>Endoscopic Sampling of the Mediastinal Lymph Nodes</em></p>
<p><strong>A</strong> - Endoscopic assessment of the mediastinal lymph nodes with endobronchial ultrasound fine-needle aspiration (EBUS-FNA) with or without endoscopic ultrasound FNA (EUS-FNA) should be offered to patients with suspected lung cancer prior to mediastinoscopy.</p>
<p><strong>M Stage in NSCLC</strong></p>
<p><em>Clinical Evaluation</em></p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - Patients with clinical stage I or II disease on the basis of a CT scan of the chest and abdomen, PET-CT and a negative clinical evaluation do not require further investigation to look for extrathoracic metastases.</p>
<p><em>Pleural Effusion</em></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - In patients being considered for active therapy, pleural effusion should be investigated with pleural aspiration and/or pleural biopsy using image guided or thoracoscopic biopsy.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - The presence of malignant cells is required to categorise the lesion as M1a.</p>
<p><em>FDG-PET CT Scanning and Detection of Distant Metastases</em></p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - All patients with NSCLC who are being considered for radical treatment should have a staging PET-CT scan to detect occult distant metastases.</p>
<p><em>Brain Metastases</em></p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - Contrast-enhanced head CT or MRI in asymptomatic patients with clinical stage I-II disease is not recommended.</p>
<p><em>Bone Metastases</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - A positive nuclear bone scan in patients with otherwise potentially curable disease should be confirmed by other studies (e.g., plain X-rays, MRI or biopsy).</p>
<p><em>Liver Metastases</em></p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - Ultrasound (US), contrast enhanced CT, FDG PET-CT or MRI can be used to characterise most benign focal hepatic abnormalities &amp;gt;10 mm.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - A definitive confirmation of a liver metastasis can only be made by needle biopsy.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - The management of patients with lesions too small to characterise by imaging and not amenable to biopsy is best guided by an estimation of the chance of metastatic disease given the clinical stage and symptoms.</p>
<p><em>Adrenal Gland Metastases</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - A negative FDG PET-CT reliably excludes adrenal metastases.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - In patients with PET-CT positive adrenal lesions pathology, confirmation may be considered unless there is overwhelming clinical and imaging evidence of widespread metastatic disease.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - In patients with indeterminate adrenal lesions on FDG PET-CT further assessment with adrenal specific CT or MRI criteria may be considered. If noninvasive imaging findings are indeterminate, adrenal sampling such as EUS-FNA, percutaneous biopsy or adrenalectomy may be considered.</p>
<p><em>Lung Metastases</em></p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - Patients with small pulmonary nodules should not be denied a curative approach without a definitive diagnosis (by biopsy, FNA or wedge resection).</p>
<p><strong>Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)</strong></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Investigation for distant metastases is recommended when intensive treatment is being considered for patients with SCLC who are considered to be at high risk of having distant metastases.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Surgery</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>NSCLC</strong></p>
<p><em>Radical Surgery (Stage I and II)</em></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Patients with stage I and II NSCLC should be considered for curative surgery whenever possible.</p>
<p><em>Reduction of Surgical Morbidity and Mortality</em></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Lung resection should be as limited as possible without compromising cancer clearance. Lobectomy remains the procedure of choice for fit patients.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Every effort should be made to avoid a thoracotomy that does not progress to a lung resection.</p>
<p><em>Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (Stage I)</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical resection may be offered to patients with clinical stage I NSCLC lung cancer.</p>
<p><em>Mediastinal Lymph Node Management of Patients with NSCLC</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Systematic nodal dissection should be undertaken for lymph node management at resection. Simple nodal sampling is not adequate and radical mediastinal lymphadenectomy is not necessary.</p>

<p><strong>A</strong> - In patients with SCLC the recommended number of systemic anticancer therapy cycles is three to six.</p>
<p><em>Second Line Systemic Anticancer Therapy</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Second line systemic anticancer therapy in patients with SCLC should be considered depending on the duration of response to first line treatment and on patients' performance status and wishes.</p>
<p><em>Maintenance</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Maintenance systemic anticancer therapy following first line treatment is not recommended.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Combined Modalities</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Postoperative (Adjuvant) Radiotherapy in Patients with NSCLC Undergoing Curative Surgery</strong></p>

<p><strong>Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in Patients with NSCLC</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong> - Concurrent chemoradiotherapy should be administered to patients with locally advanced NSCLC (suitable for radical radiotherapy) who have a good performance status (PS 0-1).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Palliative Interventions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Management of Malignant Pleural Effusion</strong></p>

<p><strong>Management of Superior Vena Cava Obstruction</strong></p>
<p><em>Stenting</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - In patients with superior vena cava obstruction due to SCLC, systemic anticancer therapy/radiotherapy is recommended as initial treatment, but stenting may be considered for relapse or persistent superior vena cava obstruction.</p>
<p><strong>Management of Bone Metastases</strong></p>
<p><em>Bisphosphonates</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Patients with lung cancer who have symptomatic bone metastases should be considered for treatment with a bisphosphonate.</p>

Databases searched include MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library. The year range covered was 2005 to 2012. Internet searches were carried out on various websites including the US National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC). The main searches were supplemented by material identified by individual members of the development group. Each of the selected papers was evaluated by two members of the group using standard SIGN methodological checklists before conclusions were considered as evidence.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Once papers have been selected as potential sources of evidence, the methodology used in each study is assessed to ensure its validity. The result of this assessment will affect the level of evidence allocated to the paper, which will in turn influence the grade of recommendation that it supports.</p>
<p>The methodological assessment is based on a number of key questions that focus on those aspects of the study design that research has shown to have a significant influence on the validity of the results reported and conclusions drawn. These key questions differ between study types, and a range of checklists is used to bring a degree of consistency to the assessment process. Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) has based its assessments on the MERGE (Method for Evaluating Research and Guideline Evidence) checklists developed by the New South Wales Department of Health, which have been subjected to wide consultation and evaluation. These checklists were subjected to detailed evaluation and adaptation to meet SIGN's requirements for a balance between methodological rigour and practicality of use.</p>
<p>The assessment process inevitably involves a degree of subjective judgment. The extent to which a study meets a particular criterion - e.g., an acceptable level of loss to follow up - and, more importantly, the likely impact of this on the reported results from the study will depend on the clinical context. To minimise any potential bias resulting from this, each study must be evaluated independently by at least two group members. Any differences in assessment should then be discussed by the full group. Where differences cannot be resolved, an independent reviewer or an experienced member of SIGN Executive staff will arbitrate to reach an agreed quality assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Tables</strong></p>
<p>Evidence tables are compiled by SIGN executive staff based on the quality assessments of individual studies provided by guideline development group members. The tables summarise all the validated studies identified from the systematic literature review relating to each key question. They are presented in a standard format to make it easier to compare results across studies, and will present separately the evidence for each outcome measure used in the published studies. These evidence tables form an essential part of the guideline development record and ensure that the basis of the guideline development group's recommendations is transparent.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Synthesising the Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Guideline recommendations are graded to differentiate between those based on strong evidence and those based on weak evidence. This judgement is made on the basis of an (objective) assessment of the design and quality of each study and a (perhaps more subjective) judgment on the consistency, clinical relevance and external validity of the whole body of evidence. The aim is to produce a recommendation that is evidence-based, but which is relevant to the way in which health care is delivered in Scotland and is therefore implementable.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasise that the grading does not relate to the importance of the recommendation, but to the strength of the supporting evidence and, in particular, to the predictive power of the study designs from which that data was obtained. Thus, the grading assigned to a recommendation indicates to users the likelihood that, if that recommendation is implemented, the predicted outcome will be achieved.</p>
<p><strong>Considered Judgement</strong></p>
<p>It is rare for the evidence to show clearly and unambiguously what course of action should be recommended for any given question. Consequently, it is not always clear to those who were not involved in the decision making process how guideline developers were able to arrive at their recommendations, given the evidence they had to base them on. In order to address this problem, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) has introduced the concept of considered judgement.</p>
<p>Under the heading of considered judgement, guideline development groups summarise their view of the total body of evidence covered by each evidence table.</p>
<p>Each guideline group considers the following factors:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Quantity, quality, and consistency of evidence </li>
    <li>External validity (generalisability) of studies </li>
    <li>Directness of application to the target population for the guideline </li>
    <li>Any evidence of potential harms associated with implementation of a recommendation </li>
    <li>Clinical impact (i.e., the extent of the impact on the target patient population, and the resources needed to treat them in accordance with the recommendation) </li>
    <li>Whether, and to what extent, any equality groups may be particularly advantaged or disadvantaged by the recommendations made </li>
    <li>Implementability (i.e., how practical it would be for the National Health Service (NHS) Scotland to implement the recommendation) </li>
</ul>
<p>Then the group is asked to summarise its view on all of these issues, both the quality of the evidence and its potential impact, before making a graded recommendation. This summary should be succinct, and taken together with its views of the level of evidence represent the first draft of the text that will appear in the guideline immediately before a graded recommendation.</p>
<p>Additional detail about SIGN's process for formulating guideline recommendations is provided in Section 7 of the companion document titled &quot;SIGN 50: A Guideline Developers' Handbook.&quot; (Edinburgh [UK]: Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. [SIGN publication; no. 50]), available from the <a href=&quot;http://www.sign.ac.uk/methodology/index.html&quot; title=&quot;SIGN Web site&quot;>SIGN Web site</a>.</p></div>"/>

<p><strong>Peer Review</strong></p>
<p>All SIGN guidelines are reviewed in draft form by independent expert referees, who are asked to comment primarily on the comprehensiveness and accuracy of interpretation of the evidence base supporting the recommendations in the guideline. A number of general practitioners (GPs) and other primary care practitioners also provide comments on the guideline from the primary care perspective, concentrating particularly on the clarity of the recommendations and their assessment of the usefulness of the guideline as a working tool for the primary care team. The draft is also sent to at least two lay reviewers in order to obtain comments from the patient's perspective.</p>
<p>It should be noted that all reviewers are invited to comment as individuals, not as representatives of any particular organisation or group. Corporate interests, whether commercial, professional, or societal have an opportunity to make representations at the national meeting stage where they can send representatives to the meeting or provide comment on the draft produced for that meeting. Peer reviewers are asked to complete a declaration of interests form.</p>
<p>The comments received from peer reviewers and others are carefully tabulated and discussed with the Chair and with the guideline development group. Each point must be addressed and any changes to the guideline as a result noted or, if no change is made, the reasons for this recorded.</p>
<p>As a final quality control check prior to publication, the guideline and the summary of peer reviewers' comments are reviewed by the SIGN Editorial Group for that guideline to ensure that each point has been addressed adequately and that any risk of bias in the guideline development process as a whole has been minimised. Each member of the guideline development group is then asked formally to approve the final guideline for publication.</p></div>"/>

    <li>Prophylactic cranial irradiation is associated with an increase in adverse effects, longer duration of hair loss and fatigue, and a small but negative impact on functioning scale. </li>
    <li>In patients with extensive disease small cell lung cancer (SCLC), careful patient selection is crucial to avoid unnecessary toxicity. Combination systemic anticancer therapy (SACT) has been shown to be less toxic and more effective than single agent treatment with oral etoposide. </li>
    <li>Percutaneous needle biopsy has an overall complication rate of 8% to 9% with 3% to 4% having major complications (e.g., pneumothorax or significant haemorrhage). There is a high false negative rate (25%) resulting in limited ability to confirm a benign diagnosis. </li>
    <li>Adult respiratory distress syndrome following talc pleurodesis has been reported as a complication in case reports but not in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). </li>
    <li>The main complications in the use of tunnelled pleural catheters appear to be blockage or dislodgement of the catheter, or seeding down the drain tract. In a retrospective audit, seeding affected 6.7% of 45 patients. Spontaneous pleuradhesis occurred in up to 25% of cases. Very few cases of pleural infection secondary to the drain have been reported. </li>
    <li>There is some evidence that concurrent chemoradiation increases toxicity in patients with limited disease SCLC. </li>
    <li>The PORT meta-analysis suggests an adverse effect of radiotherapy on survival with a hazard ratio of 1.21 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.34), favouring surgery; two year survival with adjuvant radiotherapy was 48% versus 50% in the surgery alone group. </li>

    <li>This guideline is not intended to be construed or to serve as a standard of care. Standards of care are determined on the basis of all clinical data available for an individual case and are subject to change as scientific knowledge and technology advance and patterns of care evolve. Adherence to guideline recommendations will not ensure a successful outcome in every case, nor should they be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care aimed at the same results. The ultimate judgement must be made by the appropriate healthcare professional(s) responsible for clinical decisions regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan. This judgement should only be arrived at following discussion of the options with the patient, covering the diagnostic and treatment choices available. It is, however, advised that significant departures from the national guideline or any local guidelines derived from it should be fully documented in the patient's case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken. </li>
    <li>Recommendations within this guideline are based on the best clinical evidence. Some recommendations may be for medicines prescribed outwith the marketing authorisation (MA) also known as product licence. This is known as 'off label' use.
    <p>Medicines may be prescribed off label in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>For an indication not specified within the marketing authorization </li>
        <li>For administration via a different route </li>
        <li>For administration of a different dose </li>
        <li>For a different patient population </li>
    </ul>
    <p>An unlicensed medicine is a medicine which does not have MA for medicinal use in humans.</p>
    <p>Generally 'off label' use of medicines becomes necessary if the clinical need cannot be met by licensed medicines within the marketing authorisation. Such use should be supported by appropriate evidence and experience.</p>
    <p>&quot;Prescribing medicines outside the conditions of their marketing authorisation alters (and probably increases) the prescribers' professional responsibility and potential liability.&quot;</p>
    <p>The General Medical Council (GMC) recommends that when prescribing a medicine off-label, doctors should:</p>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Be satisfied that such use would better serve the patient's needs than an authorised alternative (if one exists). </li>
        <li>Be satisfied that there is sufficient evidence/experience of using the medicines to show its safety and efficacy, seeking the necessary information from appropriate sources. </li>
        <li>Record in the patient's clinical notes the medicine prescribed and, when not following common practice, the reasons for the choice. </li>
        <li>Take responsibility for prescribing the medicine and for overseeing the patient's care, including monitoring the effects of the medicine. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Non-medical prescribers should ensure that they are familiar with the legislative framework and their own professional prescribing standards.</p>
    <p>Prior to any prescribing, the licensing status of a medication should be checked in the summary of product characteristics (SPC). The prescriber must be competent, operate within the professional code of ethics of their statutory body and the prescribing practices of their employer.</p>
