	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Identification and Referral of Infants with Congenital Muscular Torticollis (CMT)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Action Statement 1: Identify newborn infants at risk for CMT</strong>. Physicians, nurse midwives, obstetrical nurses, nurse practitioners, lactation specialists, physical therapists (PTs) or any clinician or family member must assess the presence of neck and/or facial or cranial asymmetry within the first 2 days of birth, using passive cervical rotation, passive lateral flexion, and/or visual observation as their respective training supports, when in the newborn nursery or at site of delivery. (<strong>Evidence Quality: I; Recommendation Strength: Strong</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Aggregate Evidence Quality: Level I. Based on the odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals (CI) for prediction of CMT from facial asymmetry (OR: 21.75; CI: 6.60-71.70) and plagiocephaly (OR: 23.30; CI: 7.01-70.95). </li>
    <li>Benefits:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Early identification of infants at risk for CMT or other conditions that might cause asymmetries. </li>
        <li>Early onset of intervention for infants with CMT if referred. </li>
        <li>Reduced episode of care to resolve CMT, with consequent reduction in costs. </li>
        <li>Reduced risk of needing more aggressive interventions (Botox or surgery) in the future. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Risk, Harm, and Cost:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Potential of over identification of infants may increase costs. </li>
        <li>Potential of increasing parent anxiety. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Benefit&amp;ndash;Harm Assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value Judgments: None </li>
    <li>Intentional Vagueness: None </li>
    <li>Role of Patient/Parent Preferences: Although parents may not be skilled in infant assessment, mothers who are breastfeeding may notice that the infant has greater difficulty feeding on one side, or may notice asymmetry in photographs, and these observations should trigger range of motion (ROM) screening by an attending clinician. </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B. Action Statement 2: Refer infants with asymmetries to physician and physical therapist</strong>. Physicians, nurse midwives, obstetrical nurses, nurse practitioners, lactation specialists, PTs, or any clinician or family member should refer infants identified as having positional preference, reduced cervical ROM, sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) masses, facial asymmetry, and/or plagiocephaly to their primary pediatrician and a PT as soon as the asymmetry is noted. (<strong>Evidence Quality: II; Recommendation Strength: Moderate</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Aggregate Evidence Quality: Level II evidence supports that when intervention is started earlier, it takes less time to resolve the ROM limitations (p &amp;lt;.001) and there is less need for subsequent surgical intervention (p &amp;lt;.005). Authors suggest that stretching interventions are easier for parents to administer when infants are younger, before the neck musculature strengthens and cooperation declines. </li>
    <li>Benefits:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Early differential diagnosis to confirm CMT. </li>
        <li>Early onset of intervention to resolve reduced ROM and asymmetries. </li>
        <li>Early parental education to facilitate symmetrical development. </li>
        <li>Greater infant cooperation with intervention in the first few months of life. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Risk, Harm, and Cost:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Increased cost for treatment of asymmetries that some suggest may spontaneously resolve. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Benefit&amp;ndash;Harm Assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value Judgments: Early referral to physical therapy ensures early onset of intervention, which strongly correlates with shorter episodes of care, greater success of conservative measures, and thus can lower overall costs of care. A pediatric PT will also screen and follow the infant for developmental delays, feeding challenges, and environmental factors that may be associated with or contribute to positional preference or CMT. </li>
    <li>Intentional Vagueness: For infants suspected of other causes of asymmetries (i.e., bony anomalies, fractures, neurological damage, or extra muscular masses), the PT should collaborate with the primary pediatrician to make a definitive diagnosis of CMT prior to onset of physical therapy interventions. The focus and prioritization of interventions may change depending on the type of limitations the infant presents with (e.g., neurological, musculoskeletal, cardiopulmonary, integumentary, and/or gastrointestinal). </li>
    <li>Role of Patient/Parent Preferences: Infant cooperation with stretching is easier in the first 2 months than when started after the infant develops greater head control, thus infant compliance is greater and parent adherence to home programs may be optimized. </li>
    <li>Exclusions: Infants suspected of having nonmuscular conditions that might cause asymmetrical or torticollis posturing should be fully examined by the appropriate specialists to rule out confounding diagnoses prior to initiating physical therapy. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B. Action Statement 3: Document infant history</strong>. Physical therapists should obtain a general medical and developmental history of the infant, including specific health history factors, prior to an initial screening. (<strong>Evidence Quality: II; Recommendation Strength: Moderate</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Aggregate Evidence Quality: II </li>
    <li>Benefits: A complete history of the pregnancy, delivery, known medical conditions, developmental milestones, and daily management of the infant can provide information important to the diagnosis by the PT, prognosis, and intervention. </li>
    <li>Risk, Harm, and Cost: None </li>
    <li>Benefit&amp;ndash;Harm Assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value Judgments: None </li>
    <li>Intentional Vagueness: None </li>
    <li>Role of Patient/Parent Preferences: Parents/caregivers can provide much of the history through interview and preadmission information packets; however, obtaining medical records may provide specifics that oral histories may not. </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B. Action Statement 4: Screen infants</strong>. When a clinician, parent, or caretaker indicates concern about head or neck posture and/or developmental progression, PTs should perform a screen of the neurological, musculoskeletal, integumentary, and cardiopulmonary systems, including screens of vision, gastrointestinal functions, positional preference and the structural and movement symmetry of the neck, face, and head, spine and trunk, hips, upper and lower extremities, consistent with state practice acts. (<strong>Evidence Quality: II-IV; Recommendation strength: Moderate</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Aggregate Evidence Quality: The benefits of screening infants with suspected CMT are based on a combination of level II-IV evidence and expert clinical consensus, within which selected procedures used by PTs to identify red flags have varying levels of evidence. </li>
    <li>Benefits:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Thorough screening can identify asymmetries and determine if they are consistent with CMT or not. </li>
        <li>Screening for other causes of asymmetry (i.e., hip dysplasia, scoliosis, clavicle fracture, brachial plexus injury, congenital, and/or genetic conditions) facilitates referral to specialists. </li>
        <li>For infants being treated for other conditions (i.e., brachial plexus injuries, reflux, and hip dysplasia) that are associated with higher risks for developing CMT, parents can receive preventative instruction for CMT. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Risk, Harm, and Cost: The cost of a PT screening if the infant is not already being treated for other conditions </li>
    <li>Benefit&amp;ndash;Harm Assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value Judgments: In some geographic locations or practice settings, particularly where autonomous practice is permitted, PTs may be the first to screen an infant for postural asymmetries. Infants may present for reasons other than head or neck postures, but observing overall symmetry is an element of a thorough physical therapy screen. </li>
    <li>Intentional Vagueness: None </li>
    <li>Role of Patient/Parent Preferences: None </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B. Action Statement 5: Refer infants from physical therapist to physician if red flags are identified</strong>. Physical therapists should refer infants to the primary pediatrician for additional diagnostic testing when a screen or evaluation identifies red flags (e.g., poor visual tracking, abnormal muscle tone, extra muscular masses, or other asymmetries inconsistent with CMT) or when, after 4 to 6 weeks of initial intense intervention, in the absence of red flags, little or no reduction in neck asymmetry is noted. (<strong>Evidence Quality: II; Recommendation Strength: Moderate</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>

    <li>Benefit&amp;ndash;Harm Assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value Judgments: Level II evidence demonstrates that earlier diagnosis of CMT is better, but there is no literature that documents the risks and consequences of a lack of immediate follow-up for the 20% of infants who have conditions other than CMT. While the recommendation strength is categorized as moderate based on Level II evidence, the guideline development group (GDG) believes that referral to the primary pediatrician should be categorized as a must, when any red flags are identified to collaborate in the co-management of care of the infant who may have both CMT and other medical conditions. </li>
    <li>Intentional Vagueness: In settings with direct access to physical therapy services, parents may seek evaluation services for an infant with postural asymmetry without referral from the primary pediatrician. The GDG is intentionally vague about the range of 4 to 6 weeks as the amount of time that a PT should treat an infant who is not responding to intervention. Since younger infants typically change more quickly than older infants, the GDG recommends that infants younger than 2 months who are not responding to intervention should be referred to their pediatrician sooner than infants older than 2 months, who may require more time to respond to treatment. In either case, a PT should initiate communication with the primary pediatrician when there are red flags or when a child does not respond after 4 to 6 weeks of treatment. </li>

        <li>Determines the extent of primary and secondary muscle involvement, to estimate prognosis. </li>
        <li>Establishes baselines to measure progress of ROM, strength and alignment, and infant's ability to incorporate movement through available ranges. </li>
        <li>Facilitates systematic linking of interventions to identified impairments. </li>
        <li>Standardizes measurement and documentation of body structure limitations from CMT to evaluate group outcomes across clinical settings. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Risk, Harm, and Cost:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Examination of passive cervical rotation may result in SCM snapping or a sense of &quot;giving way&quot; in approximately 8% of infants. </li>
        <li>The infant may feel some discomfort or pain, and/or may cry due to restricted movement, discomfort with ROM tests, or intolerance of general handling. </li>
        <li>In infants with undiagnosed orthopedic conditions (e.g., osteogenesis imperfecta, hemivertebrae, or cervical instability), there is a risk that overly aggressive testing of passive ROM could cause secondary injury, though this has not been reported. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Value Judgments: The evidence for selected measurement approaches varies in strength; however, measures of passive and active ROM, strength, and posture must be documented as part of any physical therapy examination and are consistent with current standards of practice. For ROM measurement, the GDG recognizes that clinical practicality has to be weighed against the desire for the most reliable measures. Use of photography, head markers, and other devices to increase measurement reliability may create undue burdens for the infant, the family, and the PT in daily clinical practice. While there is only moderate to weak evidence to justify the measurement of active cervical ROM, active ROM of the upper and lower extremities, pain or discomfort, condition of the skin folds, condition of the SCM and cervical muscles, and head shape, a lack of evidence is not equated with a lack of clinical relevance. Further, documentation of these initial examination findings sets the baseline for regularly scheduled objective reassessment and outcome measurement. </li>
    <li>Intentional Vagueness: There is no vagueness as to <em>what</em> should be documented. There is variability as to how selected body structures should be measured, due to the limited number of valid tools or methods. </li>
    <li>Role of Patient/Parent Preferences: During testing, parents may perceive that the baby experiences discomfort or that testing positions could potentially harm the baby, resulting in requests to stop testing if the baby is crying. The clinician must be aware and responsive to the parents' perceptions; it is incumbent on the clinician to fully explain the importance of the measures and the safety precautions used, so that parents and infants can comfortably and accurately complete the testing procedures. Clinicians may need to provide the infant with breaks during testing to obtain the baby's best performance and most reliable measures. Including the parent in the test procedures may help elicit the infant's best performance, calm the infant if under stress, and generally assist with building trust between the PT and the infant. </li>

    <li>Role of Parent or Patient Preferences: Parents and caregivers must accurately describe the infant's daily care routines, so positioning and home exercise programs can be tailored to maximize implementation opportunities. Fear of blame for the infant's condition may lead parents/caregivers to provide inaccurate descriptions.

    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B. Action Statement 11: Determine prognosis</strong>. Physical therapists should determine the prognosis for resolution of CMT and the episode of care after completion of the evaluation, and communicate it to the parents/caregivers. Prognoses for the extent of symptom resolution, the episode of care, and/or the need to refer for more invasive interventions are related to the age of initiation of treatment, classification of severity (see Figure 2 in the original guideline document), intensity of intervention, presence of comorbidities, rate of change, and adherence to home programming.

    <li>Risk, Harm, and Cost: Lack of determining a prognosis by either the referring pediatrician or the PT may lead to underestimation of the severity of CMT, resulting in inadequate or untimely delivery of care and/or parent/caregiver confusion about what to expect. </li>
    <li>Benefit&amp;ndash;Harm Assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value Judgments: The GDG supports the need to document the potential for improvement of CMT prior to initiating intervention. The PT's prognosis is the bridge between the evaluation of initial examination results and classification of severity with the associated interventions within an expected time frame; thus, the prognosis should include both objective outcomes to achieve, and time frames in which to achieve them. Articulating the prognosis for physical therapy management ensures clear communication of expectations for the parents/caregivers, and sets objective milestones as a basis for referral back to the primary health care provider if outcomes are not met. </li>
    <li>Intentional Vagueness: None </li>

    <li>Value Judgments: None </li>
    <li>Intentional Vagueness: The duration of treatment is dependent on the classification of severity of the CMT, with mildest forms requiring an average of 2 to 3 months of treatment, and more severe forms requiring up to 5 to 6 months of treatment. Infants who receive surgical interventions may require an additional 4 to 6 months of treatment. There are no dosage formulae to link technique and duration of stretches, repetitions within each treatment session, frequency of treatment sessions per day, overall duration of care, and frequency of clinic visits, including tapering schedules, to CMT severity classifications; thus, the GDG cannot define &quot;intense treatment&quot; except that stretching should be frequent through the day, every day. </li>

<p><strong>B. Action Statement 16: Provide a follow-up screening of the infant 3 to 12 months post-discharge</strong>. Physical therapists who treat infants with CMT should examine positional preference, the structural and movement symmetry of the neck, face and head, trunk, hips, upper and lower extremities, and developmental milestones, 3 to 12 months following discharge from physical therapy intervention or when the child initiates walking. (<strong>Evidence Quality: II; Recommendation Strength: Moderate</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Aggregate Evidence Quality: Level II evidence based on longitudinal follow-up studies with moderately large samples, reasonable follow-up periods, and reliable outcome measures. </li>
    <li>Benefits:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Detection of postures and movement consistent with relapsing CMT, particularly as infants initiate walking and move against gravity. </li>
        <li>Detection of developmental delays. </li>
        <li>Ability to restart home exercise programs if asymmetry is identified. </li>
        <li>Screening identifies causes of asymmetry, other than CMT, if asymmetries reappear. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Risk, Harm, and Cost: A single follow-up visit will minimally add to the cost of care. </li>
    <li>Benefit&amp;ndash;Harm Assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value Judgments: A single follow-up physical therapy visit for infants with a history of CMT is consistent with the APTA Guide to Physical Therapist Practice that describes the roles of a PT to include prevention of recidivism and preservation of optimal function. </li>
    <li>Intentional Vagueness: The recommended time at which follow-up is scheduled (3-12 months) is wide because the age of the infant at discharge will vary. For younger infants, discharged between 4 to 6 months of age, follow-up may need to occur sooner after discharge when the infants are initiating standing and walking. It is not known how far out into early childhood that screening should occur. Literature suggests that by 18 months, infants with delays at 10 months catch up with their peers; however, longer follow-up suggests that some infants are at greater risk for persistent neurodevelopmental conditions such as developmental coordination disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity, which may not become evident until the early school years. </li>
    <li>Role of Patient/Parent Preferences: Parents/caregivers may choose to forgo a follow-up visit if it places undue burden on the family for travel, time, or finances. Parents should be advised at discharge of the small chance that developmental conditions may become evident when the child enters school, and parents should be educated to observe for persistent asymmetry. </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>

<p>The critical appraisal forms used for diagnostic and intervention literature are based on adaptations from Fetters and Tilson and have been described previously. Selected diagnosis and intervention articles were critically appraised by the guideline development group (GDG) to establish the test standards. Volunteers completed critical appraisals of the test articles to establish interrater reliability. Volunteers qualified to be appraisers with agreement of 90% or more. Appraisers were randomly paired to read each of the remaining diagnostic or intervention articles. Each dyad compared scores for agreement and submitted a single critical appraisal form when complete. Discrepancies in scoring were negotiated by the readers. In the event that a score could not be agreed on, a member of the GDG made the final determination.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The guideline development group (GDG) was appointed by the Section on Pediatrics (SoP) to develop a guideline to address physical therapist (PT) roles in the management of congenital muscular torticollis (CMT). The procedures are documented in <em>Pediatric Physical Therapy</em> and were derived from the review of selected guideline development manuals in order to meet the goals of the SoP and to produce guidelines that parallel international processes (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong>Determining Purpose, Scope, and Outline of Content</strong></p>
<p>In 2011, the GDG solicited topics from the SoP leadership and members of its Knowledge Translation Task Group to identify what clinicians expected a clinical practice guideline (CPG) on CMT to cover. Fifty topics were organized into an online survey. Fourteen members of the SoP Knowledge Translation Task Group and clinicians who expressed interest in the CMT guidelines completed the survey, ranking the importance of each topic. These rankings influenced the scope and outline of the CPG content; 45 of the 50 topics are addressed in this document. (Survey results are available from the authors.)</p>
<p><strong>Levels of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Recommendation grades are derived to be consistent with the Building Recommendations In a Developer's Guideline Editor (BRIDGE-Wiz) software deontics. BRIDGE-Wiz is designed to generate clear and implementable recommendations consistent with the Institute of Medicine recommendations for transparency. The GDG believes it is important to consider all controlled research designs (randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, diagnostic, prognostic, prospective, and cohort studies) to equalize their importance in rehabilitation decision making. While it is recognized that experimental studies are the only designs that suggest causality, the difference between level I and II evidence is based on methodological rigor within each design, rather than solely on the study design. Thus, the score from the critical appraisal process determines whether an intervention or diagnosis study is a level I or II.</p>
<p>Theoretical/foundational (designated by D in the Grades of Recommendation for Action Statements) and practice recommendations (designated by P in the Grades of Recommendation for Action Statements) are not generated with BRIDGE-Wiz. The former are based on basic science or theory, and the latter are determined by the GDG to be representative of current physical therapy practice or exceptional situations that exist for which studies cannot be performed.</p>
<p>Research recommendations (designated by R in the Grades of Recommendation for Action Statements) are provided by the GDG to identify missing or conflicting evidence, for which studies might improve measurement and intervention efficacy, or minimize unwarranted variation.</p></div>"/>

<p>This clinical practice guideline (CPG) was evaluated by the third author and 2 external reviewers using AGREE II. AGREE II is an established instrument designed to assess the quality of clinical practice guidelines using 23 items in 6 domains (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at <a href=&quot;http://links.lww.com/PPT/A48&quot; title=&quot;LWW Web site&quot;>http://links.lww.com/PPT/A48</a> [see also the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). Each item is rated using a 7-point scale, with 7 representing the highest score. Each item includes specific criteria, although reviewer judgment is necessary in applying the criteria. The AGREE II appraisal process supported an iterative process to improve the quality of the guideline. Domain scores for the congenital muscular torticollis (CMT) CPG ranged from 98% to 67%. The 3 reviewers unanimously agreed to recommend the guideline for use. Scores were discussed by the guideline development group (GDG); where possible, items were addressed in the CPG following the AGREE II reviews. Thus, the percentages are likely higher in the final version of the CPG.</p>
<p><strong>External Review Process by Stakeholders</strong></p>
<p>This CPG underwent 3 formal reviews. First draft reviewers were invited stakeholders representing medicine, surgery, nursing, midwifery, physical therapy (PT) clinicians and researchers, and a parent representative. The second draft was posted for public comment on the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) Section on Pediatrics (SoP) website; notices were sent via email and an electronic newsletter to SoP members, literature appraisers, and clinicians who inquired about the CPG during its development. Two <em>Pediatric Physical Therapy</em> journal reviewers read the third draft. Comments from each round of reviews were considered for successive revisions.</p></div>"/>

    <li>Adverse effects of Botox include pain and bruising, temporary dysphagia, and neck weakness, all of which are reported to resolve. </li>
    <li>Identification of infants with congenital muscular torticollis (CMT) has the potential of increasing parental anxiety. </li>
    <li>Identification of red flags may cause additional family stress due to concerns about the infant having more serious health conditions. </li>
    <li>Examination of passive cervical rotation may result in sternocleidomastoid muscle snapping or a sense of &quot;giving way&quot; in approximately 8% of infants, which may or may not cause momentary infant discomfort; however, the documented long-term outcomes are positive. </li>
    <li>The infant may feel some discomfort or pain, and/or may cry due to restricted movement, discomfort with range of motion (ROM) tests, or intolerance of general handling. </li>
    <li>In infants with undiagnosed orthopedic conditions (e.g., osteogenesis imperfecta, hemivertebrae, or cervical instability), there is a risk that overly aggressive testing of passive ROM could cause secondary injury, though this has not been reported. </li>
    <li>Lack of determining a prognosis by either the referring pediatrician or the physical therapist may lead to underestimation of the severity of CMT, resulting in inadequate or untimely delivery of care and/or parent/caregiver confusion about what to expect. </li>
    <li>Parents/caregivers may apply interventions incorrectly. </li>
    <li>There is an unknown amount of risk that discharge from physical therapy services with 5&amp;deg; residual asymmetry will progress to other anatomical areas (cervical scoliosis, craniofacial) or return as the infant grows. There appears to be a slightly higher risk than general prevalence of developmental coordination disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder that is not associated with the type or severity of the CMT, although more studies are needed. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>This guideline is intended for clinicians, family members, educators, researchers, policy makers, and payers. It is not intended to be construed or to serve as a legal standard of care. As rehabilitation knowledge expands, clinical guidelines are promoted as syntheses of current research and provisional proposals of recommended actions under specific conditions. Standards of care are determined on the basis of all clinical data available for an individual patient/client and are subject to change as knowledge and technology advance, patterns of care evolve, and patient/family values are integrated. This clinical practice guideline is a summary of practice recommendations that are supported with current published literature that has been reviewed by expert practitioners and other stakeholders. These parameters of practice should be considered guidelines only, not mandates. Adherence to them will not ensure a successful outcome in every patient, nor should they be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care aimed at the same results. The ultimate decision regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made using the clinical data presented by the patient/client/family, the diagnostic and treatment options available, the patient's values, expectations, and preferences, and the clinician's scope of practice and expertise. The guideline development group suggests that significant departures from accepted guidelines should be documented in patient records at the time the relevant clinical decisions are made.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Guideline Implementation Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>A growing body of literature exists on the uptake of evidence into practice. The following suggestions are provided as possible strategies for clinicians to implement the action statements of this clinical practice guidelines (CPG), but are not an exhaustive review. Many variables affect the successful translation of evidence into practice; clinicians will need to assess their own practice structures, cultures, and clinical skills to determine how to best implement the action statements as individuals and how to facilitate implementation by others.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies for Individual Implementation</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Keep a copy of the congenital muscular torticollis (CMT) CPG in a location that is easy to reference. </li>
    <li>Compare items in the recommended examination list to determine what should be added to an examination to increase adherence. </li>
    <li>Adapt examination forms to include a place to document each of the recommended measures. </li>
    <li>Seek training in the use of the recommended standardized measures and/or intervention approaches. </li>
    <li>Build relationships with referral sources to encourage early referral of infants. </li>
    <li>Measure individual service outcomes of care (e.g., patient effect across the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health [ICF] domains, costs, and parent/caregiver satisfaction). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strategies for Facilitating CPG Implementation in Other Clinicians</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Recognize that adoption of the recommendations by others may require time for learning about the CMT CPG content, developing a positive attitude toward adopting the action statements, comparing what is already done with the recommended actions, trying selected changes in practice to determine their efficacy, and finally, routine integration of the tested changes. </li>
    <li>Identify early adopting clinicians as opinion leaders to introduce the guideline via journal clubs or staff presentations. </li>
    <li>Identify gaps in knowledge and skills following presentation of content to determine needs of staff for adopting recommendations. </li>
    <li>Use documentation templates to facilitate standardized collection and implementation of the recommended measures and actions. </li>
    <li>Institute quality assurance processes to monitor the routine collection of recommended data and implementation of recommendations, and to identify barriers to complete collection. </li>
    <li>Measure structural outcomes (e.g., dates of referral, equipment availability), process outcomes (e.g., use of tests and measures, breadth of plan of care), and service outcomes (e.g., patient effect across the ICF domains, costs, and parent/caregiver satisfaction). </li>
