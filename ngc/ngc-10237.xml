	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Assumptions of the Writing Panel</strong></p>
<p>Before these Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) are consulted, it is assumed that:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>The clinician knows the contraindication to the utilization of certain medications and the anesthetic or important surgical contraindications to operative interventions. </li>
    <li>Prescription of narcotic medicine for refractory pain (oral or transcutaneous opioids) should be monitored, intermittent or low dose in conjunction with other therapies. </li>
    <li>The patient has a diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the knee. </li>
    <li>The patient is symptomatic including pain, instability, stiffness, and/or deformity that leads to loss of function. </li>
    <li>The patient's symptoms are consistent with the history, physical exam, and imaging findings. </li>
    <li>The imaging findings are consistent with osteoarthritis (joint space narrowing, sclerosis, and osteophytes). </li>
    <li>Anterior-posterior (AP) and/or posterior-anterior (PA)-flexion weight-bearing, lateral, and patellar view radiographs are obtained. </li>
    <li>If a patient has a body mass index (BMI) &amp;ge;30, discussion of and/or referral for weight loss and nutritional counseling is strongly recommended. </li>
    <li>The physical examination, history, and imaging studies have excluded the following potential causes of knee pain:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Referred pain from the spine </li>
        <li>Ipsilateral hip arthritis </li>
        <li>Ankle/foot deformity </li>
        <li>Vascular disease (arterial or venous) </li>
        <li>Non-articular causes of knee pain including soft-tissue disorders </li>
        <li>Neoplasm </li>
        <li>Neuropathy </li>
        <li>Stress fractures, insufficiency fracture, osteonecrosis, or symptomatic metabolic bone disease </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The physician has an informed discussion with the patient about the treatment options and that the optimum treatment options may change over time for the patient. Before operative intervention is recommended, the appropriateness and potential efficacy of non-operative intervention has been considered. </li>
    <li>There will be patients for whom arthroplasty may be the most appropriate treatment, but the appropriateness of arthroplasty was not considered in these appropriate use criteria. </li>
    <li>At the time of the development of these appropriate use criteria, the serotonin-norepineprhine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) were not part of the guideline and were not part of the data analyzed. Therefore, they were not considered as a treatment.&amp;nbsp; </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Results of Appropriateness Rating</strong></p>
<p>The AUC tables (see pages 20-307 in the original guideline document) contain the final appropriateness ratings assigned by the sixteen members of the voting panel. Patient characteristics are found under the column titled &quot;Scenario.&quot; The AUC for each patient scenario can be found within each of the 10 treatment rows. These criteria are formatted by appropriateness labels (i.e., &quot;R&quot;=Rarely Appropriate, &quot;M&quot;=May Be Appropriate, and &quot;A&quot;=Appropriate), median rating, and + or - indicating agreement or disagreement amongst the voting panel, respectively.</p></div>"/>

<p>The Guideline Work Group formulates questions and sets inclusion criteria for the literature review. AAOS staff research analyst appraises research studies that meet the inclusion criteria using the APPRAISE system adopted from the GRADE Working Group. The studies are classified into four categories for evidence appraisal: 1) Incidence &amp;amp; Prevalence, 2) Screening &amp;amp; Diagnosis, 3) Prognosis, and 4) Treatment. Literature is appraised using the series of questions in each domain. To arrive at the quality and applicability of the evidence for a given outcome, all domains except &quot;Statistical Power&quot; are termed &quot;flawed&quot; if one or more of the evaluation domains are answered &quot;No,&quot; or if there are two or more &quot;Unclear&quot; answers. The &quot;Statistical Power&quot; domain is considered flawed if a given study did not enroll enough patients to detect a standardized difference between means of at least 0.2. </p>
<p>The Strength of Evidence for each article is determined by the appraisal of its quality and applicability. For example, if the quality of the study is &quot;High,&quot; the strength cannot be further upgraded so the final study strength is also &quot;High,&quot; if applicability is &quot;High&quot; or &quot;Moderate.&quot; If the quality of the study is &quot;Very Low,&quot; the evidence is considered too weak to allow for increased confidence in it, so the final study strength will be &quot;Low&quot; regardless of how applicable it is. The preliminary study strength can be upgraded by one step if the applicability is &quot;High&quot; or downgraded by one level if applicability is &quot;Low.&quot; Study strength is not modified if the applicability is &quot;Moderate.&quot; </p>
<p>The combination of Quality and Applicability categories determine the strength of evidence of each article. Each study's quality and applicability is assumed to have &quot;high&quot; quality and applicability at the start, but is downgraded if the domains are flawed. The combine quality and applicability scores determine the strength of evidence for a study.</p>

The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) uses the Research and Development/University of California, Los Angeles (RAND/UCLA) Appropriateness Method (RAM). The process includes these steps: reviewing the results of the evidence analysis, compiling a list of clinical vignettes, and having an expert panel comprised of representatives from multiple medical specialties to determine the appropriateness of each of the clinical indications for treatment as &quot;Appropriate,&quot; &quot;May be Appropriate,&quot; or &quot;Rarely Appropriate.&quot;</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) uses the Research and Development/University of California, Los Angeles (RAND/UCLA) Appropriateness Method (RAM). Based on the topics in the AAOS Treatment of Osteoarthritis of the Knee evidence-based clinical practice guideline, members of the writing panel developed a list of 576 patient scenarios and ten treatments. The review panel reviewed these scenarios and treatments independently to ensure that they were representative of patients and scenarios clinicians are likely to encounter. The voting panel participated in two rounds of voting. During the first round of voting, the voting panel was given approximately one month to independently rate the appropriateness of the ten treatments for the 576 patient scenarios as &quot;Appropriate,&quot; &quot;May Be Appropriate,&quot; or &quot;Rarely Appropriate&quot; via an electronic ballot. After the first round of appropriateness ratings were submitted, AAOS staff calculated the median ratings for each patient scenario and specific treatment. An in-person voting panel meeting was held in Rosemont, IL on October 18th of 2013. During this meeting, voting panel members addressed the scenarios/treatments which resulted in disagreement (definition of disagreement can be found in Table 3 in the original guideline document). The voting panel members were asked to rerate their first round ratings during and after the voting panel meeting, only if they were persuaded to do so by the discussion and available evidence. Voting occurred during the in-person meeting and continued for approximately 3 weeks following the meeting. The voting panel determined appropriateness by rating scenarios (i.e., criteria) as &quot;Appropriate,&quot; &quot;May Be Appropriate,&quot; or &quot;Rarely Appropriate.&quot; There was no attempt to obtain consensus about appropriateness.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Developing Criteria</span></strong></p>
<p>Members of the Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) for Non-Arthroplasty Treatment of Osteoarthritis of the Knee writing panel, who are orthopaedic specialists in treating knee-related injuries/diseases, developed clinical scenarios using the following guiding principles:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Patient scenarios must include a broad spectrum of patients that may be eligible for treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee [<em>comprehensive</em>] </li>
    <li>Patient indications must classify patients into a unique scenario [<em>mutually exclusive</em>] </li>
    <li>Patient indications must consistently classify similar patients into the same scenario [<em>reliable, valid indicators</em>] </li>
</ul>
<p>The writing panel developed the scenarios by categorizing patients in terms of indications evident during the clinical decision making process (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document). These scenarios relied upon definitions and general assumptions, mutually agreed upon by the writing panel during the development of the scenarios. These definitions and assumptions were necessary to provide consistency in the interpretation of the clinical scenarios among experts voting on the scenarios and readers using the final criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Formulating Indications and Scenarios</strong></p>
<p>The AUC writing panel began the development of the scenarios by identifying clinical indications typical of patients commonly presenting with osteoarthritis of the knee in clinical practice. Indications are most often parameters observable by the clinician, including symptoms or results of diagnostic tests. Additionally, &quot;human factor&quot; (e.g., activity level) or demographic variables can be considered.</p>
<p>Indications identified in clinical trials (derived from patient selection criteria) included in AAOS Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) served as a starting point for the writing panel and ensured that these AUC referred to the evidence base for the Treatment of Osteoarthritis of the Knee CPG. The writing panel considered this initial list and other indications based on their clinical expertise and selected the most clinically relevant indications (see Table 5 in the original guideline document). The writing panel then defined distinct classes for each indication in order to stratify/categorize the indication (see Table 5 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>The writing panel organized these indications into a matrix of clinical scenarios that addressed all combinations of the classifications. The writing panel was given the opportunity to remove any scenarios that rarely occur in clinical practice, but agreed that all scenarios were clinically relevant. The major clinical decision making indications chosen by the writing panel divided the matrix of clinical scenarios into chapters, as follows: Function-Limiting Pain, Range of Motion Extension/Flexion, Ligamentous Instability (not to include antalgic giving way), Pattern of Arthritic Involvement, Imaging (joint space in the most involved compartment), Limb Alignment, Mechanical Symptoms, and Age (see Table 5 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>Creating Definitions and Assumptions</strong></p>
<p>The AUC for Non-Arthroplasty Treatment of Osteoarthritis of the Knee writing panel constructed concise and explicit definitions for the indications and classifications. This standardization helped ensure the way that the writing panel defined function-limiting pain, range of motion extension/flexion, ligamentous instability (not to include antalgic giving way), pattern of arthritic involvement, imaging (joint space in the most involved compartment), limb alignment, mechanical symptoms, and age was consistent among those reading the clinical scenario matrix or the final criteria. Definitions drew explicit boundaries when possible and were based on standard medical practice or existing literature.</p>
<p>Additionally, the writing panel formulated a list of general assumptions in order to provide more consistent interpretations of a scenario (see Assumptions of the Writing Panel in the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field). These assumptions differed from definitions in that they identified circumstances that exist outside of the control of the clinical decision making process.</p>
<p>Assumptions also addressed the use of existing published literature regarding the effectiveness of treatment and/or the procedural skill level of physicians. Additionally, assumptions highlighted intrinsic methods described in this document such as the role of cost considerations in rating appropriateness or the validity of the definition of appropriateness. The main goal of assumptions was to focus scenarios so that they apply to the average patient presenting to an average physician at an average facility.</p>
<p><strong>Voting Panel Modifications to Writing Panel Materials</strong></p>
<p>The original indications table constructed by the Writing Panel was modified by the Voting Panel during the round two discussions. See the &quot;Methodology&quot; section in the original guideline document for additional details of Voting Panel modifications.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Reviewing Scenarios</span></strong></p>
<p>After the writing panel developed the scenarios, the AUC for Non-Arthroplasty Treatment of Osteoarthritis of the Knee review panel reviewed the proposed chapters in order to ensure that they were representative of patients and scenarios clinicians are likely to encounter. The review panel was comprised of both orthopaedic surgeons who routinely perform treatments for osteoarthritis of the knee and other specialties that may refer patients with osteoarthritis of the knee to a specialist. No member of this panel participated in the writing panel's initial development of the scenarios or participated in the voting panel's appropriateness rating of the scenarios.</p>
<p>Review panel members considered the lists of scenarios, definitions, assumptions, and the literature review associated with each scenario. Each independent reviewer suggested potential modifications to the content or structure of the lists and literature review. The writing panel provided the final determination of modifications to the indications, scenarios, assumptions, and literature review that would be included in the materials sent to the voting panel.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Determining Appropriateness</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Voting Panel</strong></p>
<p>A multidisciplinary panel of clinicians was assembled to determine the appropriateness of treatments for osteoarthritis of the knee. This group consisted of approximately 50% specialists and 50% non-specialists. Two non-voting moderators, who are orthopaedic surgeons but are not specialists in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee, facilitated the voting panel. The moderators were familiar with the methods and procedures of AAOS AUC and led the panel (as non-voters) in discussions. Additionally, no member of the voting panel was involved in the development (writing panel) or independent review (review panel) of the scenarios.</p>
<p>The voting panel used a modified Delphi procedure to determine appropriateness ratings. The voting panel participated in two rounds of voting while considering evidence-based information provided in the literature review. While cost is often a relevant consideration, panelists focused their appropriateness ratings on the effectiveness of treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee.</p>
<p><strong>Rating Appropriateness</strong></p>
<p>When rating the appropriateness of a scenario, the voting panel considered the following definition:</p>
<p class=&quot;Indent&quot;>&quot;An appropriate treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee is one for which the treatment is generally acceptable, is a reasonable approach for the indication, and is likely to improve the patient's health outcomes or survival.&quot;</p>
<p>They then rated each scenario using their best clinical judgment, taking into consideration the available evidence, for an average patient presenting to an average physician at an average facility as follows:</p>

<p>Each panelist uses the scale below to record their response for each scenario:</p>
<p><em>Appropriateness of [Topic]</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Rarely Appropriate: 1, 2, 3 </li>
    <li>May Be Appropriate: 4, 5, 6 </li>
    <li>Appropriate: 7, 8, 9 </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Round One Voting</strong></p>
<p>The first round of voting occurred after completion of the independent review of the scenarios by the review panel and approval of the final indications, scenarios, and assumptions by the writing panel. The voting panel rated the scenarios electronically using a personalized ballot created by AAOS staff using the AAOS AUC Electronic Ballot Tool. There was no interaction between panel members while completing the first round of voting. Panelists considered the following materials:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The instructions for rating appropriateness </li>
    <li>The completed literature review, that is appropriately referenced when evidence is available for a scenario </li>
    <li>The list of indications, definitions, and assumptions, to ensure consistency in the interpretation of the clinical scenarios </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Round Two Voting</strong></p>
<p>The second round of voting occurred after the in-person voting panel meeting on October 18th, 2013. Before the in-person meeting started, each panelist received a personalized document that included their first round ratings along with summarized results of the first-round ratings that resulted in disagreement. These results indicated the frequency of ratings for a scenario for all panelists. The document contained no identifying information for other panelists' ratings. The moderator also used a document that summarized the results of the panelists' first round voting. These personalized documents served as the basis for discussions of scenarios which resulted in disagreement.</p>
<p>During the discussion, the voting panel members were allowed to record a new rating for any scenarios if they were persuaded to do so by the discussion or the evidence. Additionally, voting panel members were allowed to submit any amended ratings (i.e., second round ratings) until November 6th, 2013. After the final ratings were submitted, AAOS staff used the AAOS AUC Electronic Ballot Tool to export the median values and level of agreement for all voting items. There was no attempt to obtain consensus among the panel members.</p>
<p><strong>Final Ratings</strong></p>
<p>Using the median value of the second round ratings, AAOS staff determined the final levels of appropriateness. Disagreement among raters can affect the final rating. Agreement and disagreement were determined using the BIOMED definitions of Agreement and Disagreement, as reported in the RAND/UCLA Appropriate Method User's Manual, for a panel of 14-16 voting members (see Table 2 in the original guideline document). For this panel size, disagreement is defined as when &amp;ge;5 members' appropriateness ratings fell within the appropriate (7-9) and rarely appropriate (1-3) ranges for any scenario (i.e., &amp;ge;5 members' ratings fell between 1-3 and &amp;ge;5 members' ratings fell between 7-9 on any given scenario and its treatment). If there is still disagreement in the voting panel ratings after the second round of voting, that voting item is labeled as &quot;5&quot; regardless of median score. Agreement is defined as &amp;le;4 panelists rated outside of the 3-point range containing the median.</p>
