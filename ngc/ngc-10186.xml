	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Key Principles of Care</span></strong></p>
<p>When agreeing a treatment plan with the person, take into account their concerns and expectations, and discuss:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The severity of the pain, and its impact on lifestyle, daily activities (including sleep disturbance) and participation<sup>1</sup> </li>
    <li>The underlying cause of the pain and whether this condition has deteriorated </li>
    <li>Why a particular pharmacological treatment is being offered </li>
    <li>The benefits and possible adverse effects of pharmacological treatments, taking into account any physical or psychological problems, and concurrent medications </li>
    <li>The importance of dosage titration and the titration process, providing the person with individualised information and advice </li>
    <li>Coping strategies for pain and for possible adverse effects of treatment </li>
    <li>Non-pharmacological treatments, for example, physical and psychological therapies (which may be offered through a rehabilitation service) and surgery (which may be offered through specialist services). </li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about involving people in decisions and supporting adherence, see <a href=&quot;http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG76&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;>Medicines adherence</a> (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [NICE] clinical guideline 76).</p>
<p>Consider referring the person to a specialist pain service and/or a condition-specific service<sup>2</sup> at any stage (see below), including at initial presentation and at the regular clinical reviews, if:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>They have severe pain or </li>
    <li>Their pain significantly limits their lifestyle, daily activities (including sleep disturbance) and participation<sup>1</sup> or </li>
    <li>Their underlying health condition has deteriorated. </li>
</ul>
<p>Continue existing treatments for people whose neuropathic pain is already effectively managed, taking into account the need for regular clinical reviews.</p>
<p>When introducing a new treatment, take into account any overlap with the old treatments to avoid deterioration in pain control.</p>
<p>After starting or changing a treatment, carry out an early clinical review of dosage titration, tolerability and adverse effects to assess the suitability of the chosen treatment.</p>
<p>Carry out regular clinical reviews to assess and monitor the effectiveness of the treatment. Each review should include an assessment of:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Pain control </li>
    <li>Impact on lifestyle, daily activities (including sleep disturbance) and participation<sup>1</sup> </li>
    <li>Physical and psychological wellbeing </li>
    <li>Adverse effects </li>
    <li>Continued need for treatment </li>
</ul>
<p>When withdrawing or switching treatment, taper the withdrawal regimen to take account of dosage and any discontinuation symptoms.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>1</sup>The World Health Organization ICF (International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health) (2001) defines participation as 'A person's involvement in a life situation.' It includes the following domains: learning and applying knowledge, general tasks and demands, mobility, self-care, domestic life, interpersonal interactions and relationships, major life areas, community, and social and civil life.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>2</sup>A condition-specific service is a specialist service that provides treatment for the underlying health condition that is causing neuropathic pain. Examples include neurology, diabetology and oncology services.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Treatment</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>All Neuropathic Pain (Except Trigeminal Neuralgia)</strong></p>
<p>Offer a choice of amitriptyline, duloxetine, gabapentin or pregabalin as initial treatment for neuropathic pain (except trigeminal neuralgia)<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>If the initial treatment is not effective or is not tolerated, offer one of the remaining 3 drugs, and consider switching again if the second and third drugs tried are also not effective or not tolerated.</p>
<p>Consider tramadol only if acute rescue therapy is needed.</p>
<p>Consider capsaicin cream<sup>4</sup> for people with localised neuropathic pain who wish to avoid, or who cannot tolerate, oral treatments.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>3</sup>At the time of publication (November 2013), amitriptyline did not have a UK marketing authorisation for this indication, duloxetine is licensed for diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain only, and gabapentin is licensed for peripheral neuropathic pain only, so use for other conditions would be off-label. In addition, the Lyrica (Pfizer) brand of pregabalin has patent protection until July 2017 for its licensed indication of treatment of peripheral and central neuropathic pain; until such time as this patent expires generic pregabalin products will not be licensed for specific indications and their use may be off-label and may infringe the patent, see summaries of product characteristics of pregabalin products for details. The prescriber should follow relevant professional guidance, taking full responsibility for the decision. Informed consent should be obtained and documented. See the General Medical Council's <a href=&quot;http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/ethical_guidance/14316.asp&quot; title=&quot;General Medical Council Web site&quot;>Good practice in prescribing and managing medicines and devices</a> for further information.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>4</sup>At the time of publication (November 2013), capsaicin cream (Axsain) had a UK marketing authorisation for post-herpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy, so use for other conditions would be off-label. The SPC states that this should only be used for painful diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy 'under the direct supervision of a hospital consultant who has access to specialist resources'. The prescriber should follow relevant professional guidance, taking full responsibility for the decision. Informed consent should be obtained and documented. See the General Medical Council's <a href=&quot;http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/ethical_guidance/14316.asp&quot; title=&quot;General Medical Council Web site&quot;>Good practice in prescribing and managing medicines and devices</a> for further information.</p>
<p><strong>Treatments That Should Not Be Used</strong></p>
<p>Do not start the following to treat neuropathic pain in non-specialist settings, unless advised by a specialist to do so:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Cannabis sativa extract </li>
    <li>Capsaicin patch </li>
    <li>Lacosamide </li>
    <li>Lamotrigine </li>
    <li>Levetiracetam </li>
    <li>Morphine </li>
    <li>Oxcarbazepine </li>
    <li>Topiramate </li>
    <li>Tramadol (for long-term use) </li>
    <li>Venlafaxine </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Trigeminal Neuralgia</strong></p>
<p>Offer carbamazepine as initial treatment for trigeminal neuralgia.</p>
<p>If initial treatment with carbamazepine is not effective, is not tolerated or is contraindicated, consider seeking expert advice from a specialist and consider early referral to a specialist pain service or a condition-specific service.</p></div>"/>

<p>The evidence reviews used to develop the guideline recommendations were underpinned by systematic literature searches, following the methods described in The guidelines manual (2012 [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). The aim of the systematic searches was to comprehensively identify the published evidence to answer the review questions developed by the Guideline Development Group and Internal Clinical Guidelines Technical Team.</p>
<p>The search strategies for the review questions were developed by the Information Services Team with advice from the Internal Clinical Guidelines Technical Team. Structured questions were developed using the PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) model and translated into search strategies using subject heading and free text terms. The strategies were run across a number of databases with no date restrictions imposed on the searches.</p>
<p>The National Health Service (NHS) Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) and the Health Economic Evaluations Database (HEED) were searched for economic evaluations. Search filters for economic evaluations and quality of life studies were used on bibliographic databases. There were no date restrictions imposed on the searches.</p>
<p>Guideline Development Group members were also asked to alert the Internal Clinical Guidelines Technical Team to any additional evidence, published, unpublished or in press, that met the inclusion criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Scoping Searches</strong></p>
<p>When the guideline was initially referred to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), scoping searches were undertaken on the following websites and databases between October 28th and November 3rd 2008 to provide information for scope development and project planning. Browsing or simple search strategies were employed.</p>
<p>The search results were used to provide information for scope development and project planning.</p>

<p>Ahead of the development searches in 2012 for the full update of the guideline, additional scoping searches were conducted to identify any new drugs that had been licensed since the initial scoping in 2008. The British National Formulary (BNF), New Drugs Online and the electronic Medicines Compendium websites were searched between 26th and 27th April 2012.</p>
<p><strong>Main Searches</strong></p>
<p>The following sources were searched for the topics presented in the sections below.</p>

</ul>
<p><em>Systematic Review Searches</em></p>
<p>The searches were conducted between 17th and 31st July 2012 and one strategy was designed to identify evidence on the following clinical questions:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>What is the clinical effectiveness of different pharmacological treatments as monotherapy compared with each other or placebo for the management of neuropathic pain in adults, outside of specialist pain management services? </li>
    <li>What is the clinical effectiveness of different pharmacological treatments as combination therapy compared with other combination therapies, monotherapy or placebo for the management of neuropathic pain in adults, outside of specialist pain management services? </li>
</ul>
<p>The MEDLINE search strategy is presented in Appendix D in the full version of the original guideline document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) and was translated for use in all of the databases listed above.</p>
<p>Search filters to retrieve reports of randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews were appended to identify relevant evidence.</p>
<p>In addition search filters were also applied to separately identify economic evaluations and quality of life evidence. These searches were conducted between 23rd and 29th August 2012.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Systematic Review of Published Economic Evaluations</span></strong></p>
<p>A systematic review for cost-effectiveness evidence was undertaken for this guideline.</p>
<p><strong>Information Sources</strong></p>
<p>The following databases were searched for economic evidence: NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), and the Health Economic Evaluations Database (HEED). MEDLINE, MEDLINE (in-process) and EMBASE were searched using a validated economic filter to ensure any non-indexed economic studies were identified. No date filters were applied. The search strategies for health economics are included in Appendix D in the full version of the original guideline document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong>Selection Criteria for Included Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Studies that compared the costs and health consequences (cost&amp;ndash;utility analyses) of different strategies in terms of an incremental cost effectiveness ratio, or net benefit, were included. All other study types (cost-effectiveness, cost&amp;ndash;benefit, cost&amp;ndash;consequence, and comparative costing studies) were excluded.</p>
<p>Studies conducted in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries were included.</p>
<p>Studies that met the NICE reference case criteria (The guidelines manual, 2012 [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]) for applicability and quality were included. The health economist sifted the literature search results by comparing the title and abstract of the study with the selection criteria and PICO question.</p>
<p>Posters, reviews and letters, non-English studies and unpublished studies were excluded. Duplicates were excluded, and if identical study designs were available but from a different setting, the study closest to the NHS and Personal Social Services (PSS) setting was included and the other excluded.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Extraction</span></strong> </p>
<p><strong>Time-points</strong></p>
<p>The included evidence reported a variety of follow-up periods. In order to enable the comparison of studies with different follow-up periods, the Guideline Development Group (GDG) felt it important to extract outcomes at common time-points. Given the number and heterogeneity of the time-points reported in the literature, it was important to prioritise which time-points were extracted, while maintaining the ability to compare studies. Before data extraction commenced, the time-points where outcomes data were reported across the available literature were mapped and common time-points across the studies were chosen. The resulting time-points where outcomes were then extracted from the literature.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement Tools Extracted</strong></p>
<p>A large number of different measurement tools were used in the literature for a number of critical and important outcomes (particularly global improvement, physical and emotional functioning and pain). The tools for which data were extracted were those prioritised by the GDG, based on clinical relevance, the reliability and validity of the tools for measuring particular outcomes, and the frequency to which they appeared in the literature.</p>
<p>See Appendix D in the full version of the original guideline document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for more information about time-points and measurement tools extracted.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Synthesis Methods</span></strong></p>
<p>Where possible, meta-analyses were conducted to combine the results of studies for each outcome.</p>
<p>Pairwise meta-analyses were performed using a frequentist approach in Excel.</p>
<p>Network meta-analyses (NMAs) were conducted to simultaneously compare multiple treatments in a single meta-analysis, preserving the randomisation of the randomised controlled trials included in the reviews. This allows all evidence to be combined in a single internally consistent model. A mixed/multiple treatment comparison (MTC) combines both direct and indirect evidence to reduce uncertainty where there are few head-to-head trials, and also provides coherence in the effect estimate producing a more robust estimate of effect. These were used when there were data available on more than two interventions. When there were data available on only two interventions which were not connected by head-to-head evidence, a simple type of network meta-analysis, an indirect treatment comparison (ITC), was used to provide an indirect estimate of the treatment effect between both interventions.</p>
<p>A hierarchical Bayesian NMA was performed using the software WinBUGS version 1.4.3. The models were based on the approach and code provided in the NICE Decision Support Unit's Technical Support Documents on evidence synthesis, particularly Technical Support Document 2 ('A generalised linear modelling framework for pairwise and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials'; see <a href=&quot;http://www.nicedsu.org.uk/&quot; title=&quot;NICE Decision Support Web site&quot;>http://www.nicedsu.org.uk/</a>).</p>
<p>See Appendix D in the full version of the original guideline document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for information about choice of model; dichotomous, continuous, and categorical outcomes; prior distributions; running the model; outputs of network meta-analyses; and assessing how well the model fit the data.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Quality Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to assess the quality of evidence for the chosen outcomes as specified in the Guidelines Manual. See Appendix D in the full version of the original guideline document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for more information.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Undertaking Health Economic Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p>A de novo health economic model was built to inform the GDG's decision making. Full details are provided in Appendix F in the full version of the original guideline document and a summary of methods and results is provided in section 3.1.3 in the full version of the original guideline document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong>Original Health Economic Model &amp;ndash; Methods</strong></p>
<p>The model assessed the costs and effects of all treatments in the assembled effectiveness and safety evidence base for which sufficient data were available. To be included in the model, at least 1 estimate of dichotomous pain relief (30% and/or 50% relief compared with baseline) and data on withdrawal due to adverse effects were required. In total, 17 treatments met these criteria. See Appendix F in the full version of the original guideline document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for full details of the modelling carried out for the guideline.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Forming and Running the Short Clinical Guideline Development Group (GDG)</strong></p>
<p>Each short clinical guideline is developed by a unique GDG consisting of 8 to 12 members, supported by the Internal Clinical Guidelines Programme technical team at NICE. Each GDG has a Chair, healthcare professional members and a minimum of two patient and carer members. Co-opted expert advisers are recruited as appropriate. A Clinical Adviser, who has specific content expertise and additional responsibilities, may be appointed depending on the topic. Recruitment of the GDG Chair and members is carried out in accordance with NICE's policy 'Appointments to guidance producing bodies advisory to NICE' (November 2006). The development phase of the guideline takes 4&amp;ndash;6 months, and the GDG meets approximately every 4 to 6 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Developing Review Questions</strong></p>
<p>A short clinical guideline has a narrow scope and covers only part of a care pathway. It addresses approximately three subject areas covering clinical management. This will result in a small number of key clinical issues (listed in the scope). These are broken down into a defined number of review questions &amp;ndash; usually one or two per clinical management area. The exact number will be dictated by the size of the short clinical guideline remit and the amount of development time available. As with the standard clinical guideline programme, it is feasible to present a maximum of two systematic reviews per day at a GDG meeting. These review questions are formulated and structured according to the process for standard clinical guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Creating Guideline Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The smaller number of review questions results in a smaller number of guideline recommendations. The number of recommendations in each short clinical guideline is likely to be between 5 and 20. Research recommendations are formulated for short clinical guidelines. Their number is dependent on the size of the short clinical guideline remit.</p>
<p><strong>Writing the Guideline</strong></p>
<p>The full guideline is written by the Internal Clinical Guidelines Programme technical team, following the principles in chapters 9 and 10 of 'The guidelines manual' (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). The NICE guideline, NICE pathway and 'Information for the public' are written by NICE editors.</p>

    <field fieldid="146" ordby="550" id="415" name="Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" type="text">
      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Strength of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Some recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the GDG is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Must (or Must Not) Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG usually uses 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally 'must' (or 'must not') is used if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Should (or Should Not) Be Used &amp;ndash; a 'Strong' Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'offer' (and similar words such as 'refer' or 'advise') when confident that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost-effective. Similar forms of words (for example, 'Do not offer&amp;hellip;') are used when the GDG is confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Could Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'consider' when confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost-effective, but other options may be similarly cost-effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>In general, an intervention is considered to be cost-effective if either of the following criteria applies:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The intervention dominates other relevant strategies (that is, is both less costly in terms of resource use and more clinically effective than all the other relevant alternative strategies), or </li>
    <li>The intervention costs less than &amp;pound;20,000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained than the next best strategy. </li>
</ul>
<p>A health economic analysis was developed to support the Guideline Development Group (GDG) in making recommendations. The analysis was conducted according to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) methods outlined in the 'The guidelines manual 2012' and 'Guide to the methods of technology appraisals 2008'. It follows the NICE reference case (the framework NICE requests all cost-effectiveness analysis follow) in its methods.</p>
<p>A systematic review of published cost&amp;ndash;utility analyses found inconsistent and, at times, contradictory results from a heterogeneous group of studies, each of which addressed a small subgroup of potentially relevant comparators. Therefore, the GDG's health economic considerations were predominantly based on the de novo health economic model devised for this guideline.</p>
<p>The references to included studies and the respective evidence tables with the study characteristics and results are provided in Appendix F in the full version of the original guideline (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p></div>"/>

    <li>This guidance represents the view of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which was arrived at after careful consideration of the evidence available. Healthcare professionals are expected to take it fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement. However, the guidance does not override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or guardian or carer, and informed by the summary of product characteristics of any drugs they are considering. </li>
    <li>Implementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local commissioners and/or providers. Commissioners and providers are reminded that it is their responsibility to implement the guidance, in their local context, in light of their duties to avoid unlawful discrimination and to have regard to promoting equality of opportunity. Nothing in this guidance should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with compliance with those duties. </li>
    <li>For all drugs, recommendations are based on evidence of clinical and cost effectiveness and reflect whether their use for the management of neuropathic pain is a good use of National Health Service (NHS) resources. This guideline should be used in conjunction with clinical judgement and decision-making appropriate for the individual patient. </li>
    <li>The guideline will assume that prescribers will use a drug's summary of product characteristics (SPC) and the British National Formulary (BNF) to inform decisions made with individual patients (this includes obtaining information on special warnings, precautions for use, contraindications and adverse effects of pharmacological treatments). However, the Guideline Development Group (GDG) agreed that having clear statements on drug dosage and titration in the actual recommendations is crucial for treatment in non-specialist settings, to emphasise the importance of titration to achieve maximum benefit. </li>
    <li>Treatment and care should take into account individual needs and preferences. Patients should have the opportunity to make informed decisions about their care and treatment, in partnership with their healthcare professionals. If the patient is under 16, their family or carers should also be given information and support to help the child or young person to make decisions about their treatment. Healthcare professionals should follow the <a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reference-guide-to-consent-for-examination-or-treatment-second-edition&quot; title=&quot;UK Department of Health Web site&quot;>Department of Health's advice on consent</a>. If someone does not have the capacity to make decisions, healthcare professionals should follow the <a href=&quot;http://www.justice.gov.uk/protecting-the-vulnerable/mental-capacity-act&quot; title=&quot;UK Ministry of Justice Web site&quot;>code of practice that accompanies the Mental Capacity Act</a> and the <a href=&quot;http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http:/www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_085476&quot; title=&quot;UK Department of Health Archive Web site&quot;>supplementary code of practice on deprivation of liberty safeguards</a>. In Wales, healthcare professionals should follow <a href=&quot;http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sites3/page.cfm?orgid=465&amp;amp;pid=11930&quot; title=&quot;Wales Department of Health Web site&quot;>advice on consent from the Welsh Government</a>. </li>
    <li>NICE has produced guidance on the components of good patient experience in adult NHS services. All healthcare professionals should follow the recommendations in Patient <a href=&quot;http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG138&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;>experience in adult NHS services</a>. </li>
    <li>For all recommendations, NICE expects that there is discussion with the patient about the risks and benefits of the interventions, and their values and preferences. This discussion aims to help them to reach a fully informed decision. </li>
    <li>This guideline recommends some drugs for indications for which they do not have a UK marketing authorisation at the date of publication, if there is good evidence to support that use. The prescriber should follow relevant professional guidance, taking full responsibility for the decision. The service user (or those with authority to give consent on their behalf) should provide informed consent, which should be documented. See the General Medical Council's <a href=&quot;http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/ethical_guidance/14316.asp&quot; title=&quot;General Medical Council Web site&quot;>Good practice in prescribing and managing medicines and devices</a> for further information. Where recommendations have been made for the use of drugs outside their licensed indications ('off-label use'), these drugs are marked with a footnote in the recommendations. </li>
