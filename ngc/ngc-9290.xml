      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>All persons who perform fluoroscopically or computed tomographic (CT)-guided interventions in pregnant women should be aware of the potential for, and the nature of, radiation adverse effects to patients and the conceptus, as outlined in this guideline. Interventionalists and medical physicists should be knowledgeable of radiation effects and should initiate direct contact with patients and their families, as well as referring physicians, for discussion of these issues.</p>
<p>As in all medical practices involving radiation exposures, interventions should be justified, with the aim of medical exposures doing more good than harm to the patient. Diagnostic and therapeutic modalities that do not use ionizing radiation (e.g., ultrasound [US], magnetic resonance [MR] imaging) should be preferred when clinically appropriate. However, concern about the possible effects of ionizing radiation exposure on the conceptus should not preclude medically indicated diagnostic or interventional x-ray procedures when the medical benefit to the mother is justifiable.</p>
<p>Before fluoroscopically or CT-guided interventions, female patients of childbearing potential should be assessed for the possibility of pregnancy. In cases in which nonurgent high-dose procedure of the abdomen or pelvis (e.g., embolization) is contemplated, the physician should order a pregnancy test.</p>
<p>All facilities should possess, and make available for ready review, references (e.g., those in Tables 4&amp;ndash;6 of the original guideline document) that list general radiation dose estimates to the conceptus during radiographic and fluoroscopic imaging. When required, the physician and qualified medical physicist/medical physics expert should estimate radiation dose to the conceptus more accurately, by using scientifically sound methodologies such as those jointly developed by the Health Physics Society and the American National Standards Institute, or several updated models and methodologies recently developed. The range of uncertainties should also be determined.</p>
<p>All interventions should be optimized to achieve the clinical purposes with no more radiation than is necessary, given the available resources and technology. Optimizing patient or conceptus dose is not the same as minimizing patient or conceptus dose, and it is critically important to achieve the maximum possible dose reduction consistent with acceptable image quality. To that end, appropriate dose reduction techniques, as outlined in Figures 1 and 2 should be employed.</p>

                <li>Consider arm or neck across instead of groin where appropriate. </li>
                <li>Keep beam-on time to an absolute minimum. </li>
                <li>Consider use of intravascular ultrasound in place of x-ray for portions of the procedure </li>
                <li>Consider optimal status of the bladder (pre-or post-void) based on the procedure and dose estimates. </li>
                <li>Remember that dose rates will be greater and dose will accumulate faster in larger patients (such as mid-to late-term pregnant patients). </li>
                <li>Keep the tube current as low as possible by keeping the tube potential (kVp) as high as possible to achieve the appropriate compromise between image quality and low patient and conceptus dose. </li>
                <li>Keep the x-ray tube at maximal distance from the patient. </li>
                <li>Keep the image receptor (image intensifier or flat-panel detector) as close to the patient as possible. </li>
                <li>Do not overuse geometric magnification. </li>
                <li>Remove the grid during procedures on small patients or when image intensifier cannot be placed close to the patient. </li>
                <li>Always collimate as tightly as possible to the area of interest. </li>
                <li>When the procedure is unexpectedly prolonged, consider options for positioning the patient or altering the x-ray field or other means to alter direct x-ray field. However, be mindful that such angulations could increase internal x-ray scatter to the conceptus. </li>
                <li>Allow for posterior-anterior beam projections whenever possible. </li>
                <li>Use low-dose-rate pulsed fluoroscopy. </li>
                <li>Use last image hold instead of spot fluorographic images to record the study and to plan technique. </li>
                <li>Minimize exposure from digital subtraction angiography (DSA) by using a low a frame rate as possible by limiting the number of diagnostic/therapeutic goal. It may be possible to substitute fluoroscopic loops for DSA when the higher image quality provided by DSA is not clinically needed. </li>

Consider the use of automatic exposure control modes. The dose is directly proportional to the selected mAs per rotation. Use more recently available novel reconstruction algorithms to reduce noise in images thus allowing reduction of tube current or increase of noise level requirements during scanning. </li>
                <li>Reduce tube voltage (kV) to achieve the appropriate compromise between image quality and low patient and conceptus dose. Decreasing the tube voltage from 140 kV down to 110 kV will decrease the dose by approximately 60% with constant mA. </li>

<p>All equipment should be properly maintained and periodically inspected for radiation safety. Radiation output should be monitored and patient dose recorded according to local regulations and hospital policy.</p>
<p>Pregnant patients should be counseled based on sound information about the risks of radiation exposure. All discussions with patients about radiation risks, as well as the results of any conceptus and/or patient radiation dose assessments or estimates, should be documented in the procedure report and the patient's medical record. Patients should be given the results of these assessments or estimates.</p>
<p>Termination of pregnancy as a result of radiation exposure is an individual decision affected by many factors. An evaluation of overall risks should be undertaken at all dose levels. Conceptus doses lower than 100 mGy should not be considered a reason for terminating a pregnancy. Note that radiographic, fluoroscopic, and CT examinations performed in extraabdominal areas typically deliver doses to the conceptus lower than 1 mGy and that conceptus doses from examinations of the abdomen and pelvis rarely exceed 50 mGy. Estimated doses greater than 100 mGy should initiate an overall review of the potential risks, given the gestational age and patient history.</p>
<p>Pregnant women should not be involved in biomedical research projects involving fluoroscopically or CT-guided interventions (or other radiation exposure) unless the pregnancy itself is central to the research and only if alternative techniques involving less risk cannot be used.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>It has long been known that the developing conceptus is highly radiosensitive. Exposure of the conceptus to ionizing radiation can potentially lead to two types of adverse health effects, deterministic effects and stochastic effects. Deterministic effects (ie, tissue reactions) result from damage to multiple cells and may be severe enough to cause cell sterilization or death. Stochastic effects originate from damage to single cells that is sufficient to cause a mutation but that does not impair cell division. Stochastic effects (principally cancer) increase in likelihood as dose increases. Two types of risks must be addressed: the likelihood of an adverse outcome and the severity of such an outcome. </li>
    <li>The developing conceptus is radiosensitive throughout the prenatal period. The effects of radiation exposure on the conceptus depend on multiple variables including the gestational age, fetal cellular repair mechanisms, and the absorbed radiation dose level. Higher doses of ionizing radiation can cause embryonic death, congenital malformations, growth retardation, and neurologic detriment. However, there is little support in the epidemiologic literature for the hypothesis that very low doses of radiation adversely affect pregnancy outcome. Much of the current knowledge of the harmful effects of ionizing radiation is from the follow-up of atomic bomb survivors, from patients who received radiation therapy for nonmalignant conditions, and from animal studies. Considerable uncertainty still exists about the risks associated with radiation in the diagnostic dose range. For specific risks concerning the biologic effects of ionizing radiation on the conceptus, central nervous system effects, cardiovascular effects, cancer risks and congenital malformations and growth retardation risks; see the original guideline. Also see Table 1. of the original guideline for deterministic radiation effects at different stages of gestation. </li>

    <li>The clinical practice guidelines of Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) attempt to define practice principles that generally should assist in producing high quality medical care. These guidelines are voluntary and are not rules. A physician may deviate from these guidelines, as necessitated by the individual patient and available resources. These practice guidelines should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other methods of care that are reasonably directed towards the same result. Other sources of information may be used in conjunction with these principles to produce a process leading to high quality medical care. The ultimate judgment regarding the conduct of any specific procedure or course of management must be made by the physician, who should consider all circumstances relevant to the individual clinical situation. Adherence to the SIR Quality Improvement Program will not assure a successful outcome in every situation. It is prudent to document the rationale for any deviation from the suggested practice guidelines in the department policies and procedure manual or in the patient&amp;rsquo;s medical record. </li>
