      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><em>Note from the American Medical Directors Association (AMDA) and the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</em></strong>: The original full-text guideline provides an algorithm on &quot;Dementia in the Long Term Care Setting&quot; to be used in conjunction with the written text. Refer to the &quot;Guideline Availability&quot; field for information on obtaining the algorithm, as well as the full text of the guideline, which provides additional details.</p>
<p>Levels of evidence (<strong>High, Moderate, Low</strong>) and grades of recommendation (<strong>Strong, Weak, Insufficient</strong>) are defined at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong>Recognition</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Review available information about the patient's recent or past physical, functional, cognitive, and behavioral status. Look for previous diagnoses in which dementia is a key symptom. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Moderate; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>) </li>
    <li>Check current medical orders for medications that can alter cognitive function (e.g., antiarrhythmics, opioids, hypnotics, psychotropics, sedatives, medications with significant anticholinergic properties). Also ask about the use of over-the-counter medications or herbal preparations that may affect cognitive function. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Low; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>) </li>
    <li>Search for evidence of specific impairments or symptoms (e.g., neurologic or behavior symptoms) that may suggest underlying dementia. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Moderate; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>) </li>
    <li>Professional staff should observe the patient's current physical, functional, and psychosocial status. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Low; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Assessment</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;5&quot;>
    <li>Assess the patient's cognition, mood, and behavior using a validated tool, such as items in the Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 instrument. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Moderate; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>) </li>
    <li>Decide if further workup is useful and appropriate. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Moderate; Strength of Recommendation: Weak</strong>) </li>
    <li>Evaluate if the patient meets the criteria for a diagnosis of dementia (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Low; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>). </li>
    <li>Consider consultation with appropriate specialists for neuropsychiatric evaluation and testing if basic workup and testing do not enable adequate assessment of the patient's conditions, identification of the causes of the patient's symptoms, or proper management. Formal neuropsychological testing may also be helpful when the results of screening tests are inconsistent with clinical observations of the degree and type of cognitive impairment. Neuropsychological testing also has the benefit of being able to identify the patient's cognitive assets and weaknesses. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Low; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>) </li>
    <li>Soon after admission or a significant condition change, assess the patient's capabilities in various domains. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Low; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>) </li>
    <li>Prognostication is important in the long term care (LTC) setting for appropriate care planning and timely use of available resources. Prognostication is not a guarantee of future events but rather an estimate of what can reasonably be expected. Prognostication of dementia is challenging; evidence supports using age, decline in functional status and oral intake, and increasing dependence in activities of daily living (ADLs) as the most important features in determining prognosis in end-stage dementia. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Moderate; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>) </li>
    <li>Identify triggers for disruptive behaviors. Do not assume that a behavior is triggered by environmental or other nonmedical factors until alternate causes have been considered. This is especially important when patients are newly admitted, have recently been hospitalized, or have a significant change of condition. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Low; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Treatment/Intervention</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;12&quot;>
    <li>Prepare an individualized interdisciplinary care plan that defines treatment goals that are appropriate for the individual patient, taking into account the wishes of the patient and/or family; incorporates definite, measurable objectives derived from those treatment goals and; allows for modification as the patient's needs change. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Low; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>) </li>
    <li>Optimize the patient's function and quality of life utilizing specialized environment, trained caregiver staff, and activity programs in special care units. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Moderate; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>) </li>
    <li>Consider the use of complementary and alternative methods and dietary supplements. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Low; Strength of Recommendation: Weak</strong>) </li>
    <li>Consider medical interventions if appropriate. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: High; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>) </li>
    <li>Manage functional deficits. A restorative nursing program may help to optimize the function of a patient who has impaired cognition and behavior. Practitioners should help to identify patients who are likely to benefit from such interventions and authorize appropriate evaluations and management. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Low; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>) </li>
    <li>Address ethical issues. Facilities should develop policies and procedures or guidelines for managing issues such as attempted sexual activity between two cognitively impaired patients or between a cognitively impaired and a cognitively intact patient. The facility should have a systematic, consistent process for managing ethical issues and documenting patient wishes. The practitioner should help to define the potential benefits and burdens of treatments for the patient with dementia, clarify the patient's prognosis, and support decision making by families or surrogates. The practitioner should review the relevance and appropriateness to the patient's overall care various treatment recommendations made by other disciplines or consultants. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Low; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>)
    <p>Good evidence exists that artificial nutrition does not materially prolong life or improve quality of life in patients with advanced dementia. Substantial functional decline and recurrent or progressive medical illnesses may indicate that a patient who is not eating is unlikely to obtain any significant or long term benefit from artificial nutrition and hydration. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Moderate; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>)</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Monitoring</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;18&quot;>
    <li>Monitor the patient's condition and adjust management as appropriate. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Low; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>) </li>
    <li>Monitor the facility's management of dementia (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Moderate; Strength of Recommendation: Insufficient</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The quality of evidence indicates the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect is correct.</p>
<p><strong>High</strong>: At least 1 randomized controlled trial <em>OR</em> 3 pre/post interventions or other prospective interventions or 3 well-structured, relevant observational studies</p>
<p><strong>Moderate</strong>: Studies that use well-tested methods to make comparisons in a fair way, but where the results leave room for uncertainty (e.g., because of the size of the study, losses to follow-up, or the method used for selecting groups for comparison)</p>
<p><strong>Low</strong>: Studies in which the results are doubtful because the study design does not guarantee that fair comparisons can be made</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The strength of a recommendation indicates the extent to which one can be confident that adherence to the recommendation will do more good than harm.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>Strong</strong>: Benefits clearly outweigh risks. </li>
    <li><strong>Weak</strong>: Benefits are balanced with risks. </li>
    <li><strong>Insufficient</strong>: Evidence is inadequate to make a recommendation. </li>

<p>Judgments about the quality of evidence (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field) require assessing the validity of results for important outcomes in individual studies. Explicit criteria should be used in making these judgments. In the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group approach, a systematic review of available evidence guides these judgments.</p>
<p>Sequential judgments are made concerning the following factors:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The quality of evidence across studies for each important outcome </li>
    <li>Which outcomes are critical to a decision </li>
    <li>The overall quality of evidence across these critical outcomes </li>
    <li>The balance between benefits and harms </li>
    <li>The strength of recommendations </li>
</ul>
<p>Reviewers consider four key elements: study design, study quality, consistency, and directness.</p>
<p><strong>Definitions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Study design</strong> refers to the basic study design (broadly, observational studies and randomized trials).</p>
<p><strong>Study quality</strong> refers to the detailed study methods and execution. Appropriate criteria are used to assess study quality for each important outcome. For randomized trials, for example, these criteria might include the adequacy of allocation concealment, blinding, and follow up. Reasons for downgrading a quality rating must be explicit (e.g., failure to blind patients and physicians reduced the quality of evidence for an intervention's impact on pain severity, a serious limitation).</p>
<p><strong>Consistency</strong> refers to the similarity of effect estimates across studies. If there is important unexplained inconsistency in study results, confidence in the effect estimate for that outcome is reduced.</p>
<p><strong>Directness</strong> refers to the extent to which the people, interventions, and outcome measures in the studies are similar to those of interest. For example, the directness of the evidence may be uncertain if the people of interest are older, sicker, or have more comorbidity than those in the studies. To determine whether important uncertainty exists, one can ask whether there is a compelling reason to expect important differences in the effect size. Because many interventions have more or less the same relative effects across most patient groups, reviewers should not use overly stringent criteria in deciding whether evidence is direct.</p>
<p><strong>Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Criteria for decreasing the grade:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Serious (-1) or very serious (-2) limitation to study quality </li>
    <li>Important inconsistency (-1) </li>
    <li>Some (-1) or major (-2) uncertainty about directness </li>
    <li>Imprecise or sparse data (-1) </li>
    <li>High probability of reporting bias (-1) </li>
</ul>
<p>Criteria for increasing the grade:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Strong evidence of association: Significant relative risk greater than 2 (less than 0.5), based on consistent evidence from two or more observational studies, with no plausible confounders (+1) </li>
    <li>Very strong evidence of association: Significant relative risk greater than 5 (less than 0.2), based on direct evidence with no major threats to validity (+2) </li>
    <li>Evidence of a dose-response gradient (+1) </li>
    <li>All plausible confounders would have reduced the effect (+1) </li>
</ul>
<p>These criteria are cumulative &amp;ndash; e.g., if randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have serious limitations and there is uncertainty about the directness of the evidence, the grade of evidence would drop from high to low.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Original guidelines are developed by interdisciplinary workgroups, using a process that combines evidence- and consensus-based approaches. Workgroups include practitioners and others involved in patient care in long term care (LTC) facilities. Beginning with pertinent literature searches for articles and information related to the guideline subject and a draft outline/framework, each group works to develop a concise, usable guideline that is tailored to the LTC setting. Because scientific research in the LTC population is limited, many recommendations are based on findings from research involving community-living older adults. Some recommendations are based on the expert consensus opinion of practitioners and experts in the field of geriatric medicine.</p>
<p>The American Medical Directors Association (AMDA) Clinical Practice Guideline Steering Committee directs the guideline development and revision process. Each year the Steering Committee reviews all AMDA clinical practice guidelines that are 3 years old and commissions a thorough literature review to determine whether the content of each guideline remains current. The AMDA Clinical Practice Committee Chair selects the existing guidelines to be revised and new guidelines to be created based on 1) the Steering Committee's recommendations, 2) data collected, and 3) an assessment of the difficulty of development and relevance to the AMDA membership. AMDA's Board of Directors has final approval over this process.</p>

The American Medical Directors Association (AMDA), its heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns hereby disclaim any and all liability for damages of whatever kind resulting from the use, negligent or otherwise, of this clinical practice guideline. </li>
    <li>The utilization of AMDA's Clinical Practice Guideline does not preclude compliance with State and Federal regulation as well as facility policies and procedures. They are not substitutes for the experience and judgment of clinicians and caregivers. The Clinical Practice Guidelines are not to be considered as standards of care but are developed to enhance the clinician's ability to practice. </li>
    <li>AMDA guidelines emphasize key care processes and are created to be used in conjunction with facility-specific policies and procedures that guide staff and practitioner practices and performance. They are meant to be used in a manner appropriate to the population and practice of a particular facility. Guideline implementation may be affected by resources available in the facility, including staffing, and will require the involvement of all those in the facility who have a role in patient care. </li>
    <li>Long term care facilities care for a variety of individuals, including younger patients with chronic diseases and disabilities, short-stay patients needing postacute care, and very old and frail individuals suffering from multiple comorbidities. When a workup or treatment is suggested, it is crucial to consider if such a step is appropriate for a specific individual. A workup may not be indicated if the patient has a terminal or end-stage condition, if it would not change the management course, if the burden of the workup is greater than the potential benefit, or if the patient or his or her legally authorized representative would refuse treatment. It is important to carefully document in the patient's medical record the reasons for decisions not to treat or perform a workup or for choosing one treatment approach over another. </li>
