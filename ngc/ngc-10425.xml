	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

    <li>Clinicians should obtain serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level as part of the screening evaluation if primary hyperparathyroidism is suspected. (<strong><em>Clinical Principle</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>When a stone is available, clinicians should obtain a stone analysis at least once. (<strong><em>Clinical Principle</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should obtain or review available imaging studies to quantify stone burden. (<strong><em>Clinical Principle</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should perform additional metabolic testing in high-risk or interested first-time stone formers and recurrent stone formers. (<strong><em>Standard; Evidence Strength Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Metabolic testing should consist of one or two 24-hour urine collections obtained on a random diet and analyzed at minimum for total volume, pH, calcium, oxalate, uric acid, citrate, sodium, potassium and creatinine. (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should not routinely perform &quot;fast and calcium load&quot; testing to distinguish among types of hypercalciuria. (<strong><em>Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade C</em></strong>) </li>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Diet Therapies</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;8&quot;>
    <li>Clinicians should recommend to all stone formers a fluid intake that will achieve a urine volume of at least 2.5 liters daily. (<strong><em>Standard; Evidence Strength Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should counsel patients with calcium stones and relatively high urinary calcium to limit sodium intake and consume 1,000-1,200 mg per day of dietary calcium. (<strong><em>Standard; Evidence Strength Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should counsel patients with calcium oxalate stones and relatively high urinary oxalate to limit intake of oxalate-rich foods and maintain normal calcium consumption. (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>

</ol>
<p><strong>Pharmacologic Therapies</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;14&quot;>

    <li>Clinicians should offer potassium citrate therapy to patients with recurrent calcium stones and low or relatively low urinary citrate. (<strong><em>Standard; Evidence Strength Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should offer allopurinol to patients with recurrent calcium oxalate stones who have hyperuricosuria and normal urinary calcium. (<strong><em>Standard; Evidence Strength Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should offer thiazide diuretics and/or potassium citrate to patients with recurrent calcium stones in whom other metabolic abnormalities are absent or have been appropriately addressed and stone formation persists. (<strong><em>Standard; Evidence Strength Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should offer potassium citrate to patients with uric acid and cystine stones to raise urinary pH to an optimal level. (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should not routinely offer allopurinol as first-line therapy to patients with uric acid stones. (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should offer cystine-binding thiol drugs, such as alpha-mercaptopropionylglycine (tiopronin), to patients with cystine stones who are unresponsive to dietary modifications and urinary alkalinization, or have large recurrent stone burdens. (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians may offer acetohydroxamic acid (AHA) to patients with residual or recurrent struvite stones only after surgical options have been exhausted. (<strong><em>Option; Evidence Strength Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Follow-up</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;22&quot;>
    <li>Clinicians should obtain a single 24-hour urine specimen for stone risk factors within six months of the initiation of treatment to assess response to dietary and/or medical therapy. (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>After the initial follow-up, clinicians should obtain a single 24-hour urine specimen annually or with greater frequency, depending on stone activity, to assess patient adherence and metabolic response. (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should obtain periodic blood testing to assess for adverse effects in patients on pharmacological therapy. (<strong><em>Standard; Evidence Strength Grade A</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should obtain a repeat stone analysis, when available, especially in patients not responding to treatment. (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should monitor patients with struvite stones for reinfection with urease-producing organisms and utilize strategies to prevent such occurrences. (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Clinicians should periodically obtain follow-up imaging studies to assess for stone growth or new stone formation based on stone activity (plain abdominal imaging, renal ultrasonography or low dose computed tomography [CT]). (<strong><em>Expert Opinion</em></strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Body of Evidence Strength</strong></p>
<p><strong>Grade A</strong>: Well-conducted and highly-generalizable randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or exceptionally strong observational studies with consistent findings</p>
<p><strong>Grade B</strong>: RCTs with some weaknesses of procedure or generalizability or generally strong observational studies with consistent findings</p>
<p><strong>Grade C</strong>: Observational studies that are inconsistent, have small sample sizes, or have other problems that potentially confound interpretation of data</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><strong>Note</strong>: By definition, Grade A evidence is evidence about which the Panel has a high level of certainty, Grade B evidence is evidence about which the Panel has a moderate level of certainty, and Grade C evidence is evidence about which the Panel has a low level of certainty.</p>
<p><strong>American Urological Association (AUA) Nomenclature Linking Statement Type to Evidence Strength</strong></p>
<p><strong>Standard</strong>: Directive statement that an action should (benefits outweigh risks/burdens) or should not (risks/burdens outweigh benefits) be taken based on Grade A or B evidence</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Directive statement that an action should (benefits outweigh risks/burdens) or should not (risks/burdens outweigh benefits) be taken based on Grade C evidence</p>
<p><strong>Option</strong>: Non-directive statement that leaves the decision regarding an action up to the individual clinician and patient because the balance between benefits and risks/burdens appears equal or appears uncertain based on Grade A, B, or C evidence</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Principle</strong>: A statement about a component of clinical care that is widely agreed upon by urologists or other clinicians for which there may or may not be evidence in the medical literature</p>
<p><strong>Expert Opinion</strong>: A statement, achieved by consensus of the Panel, that is based on members' clinical training, experience, knowledge, and judgment for which there is no evidence</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The primary source of evidence for this guideline was the systematic review and data extraction conducted as part of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Comparative Effectiveness Review Number 61 titled <em>Recurrent Nephrolithiasis in Adults: Comparative Effectiveness of Preventative Medical Strategies</em> (2012). That report, prepared by the University of Minnesota Evidence-Based Practice Center (EPC), included searches of MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov and Web of Science for English-language studies published from 1948 through November 2011 relevant to the treatment of recurrent nephrolithiasis in adults.</p>
<p>Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and large prospective observational trials of patient populations limited to adults aged 18 years or older with a history of one or more past kidney stone episodes. Studies addressing acute pain management and treatment to promote expulsion of stones were excluded. Full details of the AHRQ search strategies and inclusion/exclusion criteria can be found in the original report.</p>
<p>To augment and broaden the body of evidence provided in the AHRQ report, the American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc. (AUA) conducted additional supplementary searches of PubMed and EMBASE for relevant articles published between January 2007 and November 2012, which were systematically reviewed using a methodology developed <em>a priori</em>. Study populations were limited to adults 18 years or older with one or more past kidney stone episodes. No limitations on study design were set, however the search protocol prioritized RCTs, controlled clinical trials (CCTs) and prospective studies with a comparison group. A total of 3,760 abstracts were obtained, from which 24 articles were selected for full-text review. All dietary and pharmacologic therapies were acceptable, with the exception of interventions addressing acute pain management for urolithiasis, treatment to promote expulsion of ureteral stones, pharmacological agents not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States, and finally imaging for suspected acute renal colic.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Data on study design, treatment parameters (e.g., dose, administration protocols, follow-up durations), patient characteristics (i.e., age, gender, race, stone composition), adverse events, and primary outcomes (as defined by study authors) were extracted to evidence tables for analysis and synthesis by the methodologist.</p>
<p><strong>Quality of Studies and Determination of Evidence Strength</strong></p>
<p>Quality of individual studies was rated as high, moderate, or low based on instruments tailored to specific study designs. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias instrument. Conventional diagnostic cohort studies, diagnostic case-control studies, or diagnostic case series that presented data on diagnostic test characteristics were evaluated using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool that evaluates the quality of diagnostic accuracy studies. Cohort studies with a comparison of interest were evaluated with the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.</p>
<p>The categorization of evidence strength is conceptually distinct from the quality of individual studies. Evidence strength refers to the body of evidence available for a particular question and includes consideration of study design, individual study quality, consistency of findings across studies, adequacy of sample sizes, and generalizability of samples, settings and treatments for the purposes of the guideline.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations of the Literature</strong></p>
<p>The Panel proceeded with full awareness of the limitations of the kidney stone literature. These limitations include heterogeneous patient groups, small sample sizes, lack of studies with diagnostic accuracy data, lack of RCTs or controlled studies with patient outcome data, and use of a variety of outcome measures. Overall, these difficulties precluded use of meta-analytic procedures or other quantitative analyses. Instead, narrative syntheses were used to summarize the evidence for the questions of interest.</p></div>"/>

<p><strong>Linking Statement Type to Evidence Strength</strong></p>

<p>In some instances, the review revealed insufficient publications to address certain questions from an evidence basis; therefore, some statements are provided as <em>Clinical Principles</em> or as <em>Expert Opinions</em> with consensus achieved using a modified Delphi technique if differences of opinion emerged. A <em>Clinical Principle</em> is a statement about a component of clinical care that is widely agreed upon by urologists or other clinicians for which there may or may not be evidence in the medical literature. <em>Expert Opinion</em> refers to a statement, achieved by consensus of the Panel, that is based on members' clinical training, experience, knowledge and judgment and for which there is no evidence. In the case of this guideline, such statement types were not included.</p></div>"/>

    <li>While these guidelines do not necessarily establish the standard of care, American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc. (AUA) seeks to recommend and to encourage compliance by practitioners with current best practices related to the condition being treated. As medical knowledge expands and technology advances, the guidelines will change. Today these evidence-based guidelines statements represent not absolute mandates but provisional proposals for treatment under the specific conditions described in each document. For all these reasons, the guidelines do not pre-empt physician judgment in individual cases. </li>
    <li>Treating physicians must take into account variations in resources, and patient tolerances, needs, and preferences. Conformance with any clinical guideline does not guarantee a successful outcome. The guideline text may include information or recommendations about certain drug uses (&quot;off label&quot;) that are not approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or about medications or substances not subject to the FDA approval process. AUA urges strict compliance with all government regulations and protocols for prescription and use of these substances. The physician is encouraged to carefully follow all available prescribing information about indications, contraindications, precautions and warnings. These guidelines and best practice statements are not in-tended to provide legal advice about use and misuse of these substances. </li>
    <li>Although guidelines are intended to encourage best practices and potentially encompass available technologies with sufficient data as of close of the literature review, they are necessarily time-limited. Guidelines cannot include evaluation of all data on emerging technologies or management, including those that are FDA-approved, which may immediately come to represent accepted clinical practices. </li>
    <li>For this reason, the AUA does not regard technologies or management which are too new to be addressed by this guideline as necessarily experimental or investigational. </li>
