	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Original Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p>Should manufacturers use National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005&amp;ndash;2008 spine data as the reference standard for spine <em>T</em>-scores?</p>
<p><strong>Task Force Statement for Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Manufacturers should NOT use NHANES 2005&amp;ndash;2008 spine data as the reference standard for spine <em>T</em>-scores but continue to use their own manufacturers' databases.</p>
<p><strong>Final Statement Approved by the Expert Panel</strong></p>
<p>Manufacturers should continue to use their own databases for the lumbar spine as the reference standard for<em> T</em>-scores. <strong>Grade: Poor-C-W</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p>Should manufacturers change from NHANES III to NHANES 2005&amp;ndash;2008 hip (femoral neck and total hip) data as the reference standard for femoral neck and total hip <em>T</em>-scores?</p>
<p><strong>Task Force Statement for Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Manufacturers should NOT change from NHANES III to NHANES 2005 to 2008 hip (femoral neck and total hip) data as the reference standard for femoral neck and total hip <em>T</em>-scores.</p>
<p><strong>Final Statement Approved by the Expert Panel</strong></p>
<p>Manufacturers should continue to use NHANES III data as the reference standard for femoral neck and total hip <em>T</em>-scores. <strong>Grade: Poor-C-W</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Original Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p>Should the normative data recommended by this Position Development Conference (PDC) be used only in the USA (or North America) or should it be the international standard?</p>
<p><strong>Task Force Statement for Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The normative data recommended by this PDC should be the international standard.</p>
<p>During the presentation, it was decided that the Expert Panel's decision should be applied internationally. Question 3 was not discussed in detail, but the arguments in Task Force brief are summarized in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Renumbered Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p>If local normative data are available (outside the USA), when and how should they be used?</p>
<p><strong>Task Force Statement for Discussion</strong></p>
<p>If local normative data are available (outside the USA), they should be used to calculate <em>Z</em>-scores but not <em>T</em>-scores.</p>
<p><strong>Final Statement Approved by the Expert Panel</strong></p>
<p>If local reference data are available, they should be used to calculate only <em>Z</em>-scores but not <em>T</em>-scores. <strong>Grade: Poor-C-W</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Renumbered Question 4</span></strong></p>
<p>Should young male or female reference norms be used to calculate <em>T</em>-scores for men?</p>
<p><strong>Task Force Statement for Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Young female reference norms should be used to calculate <em>T</em>-scores for men.</p>
<p><strong>Final Statement Approved by the Expert Panel</strong></p>
<p>A uniform Caucasian (non-race adjusted) female reference database should be used to calculate <em>T</em>-scores for men of all ethnic groups. <strong>Grade: Poor-C-L</strong></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Definitions</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong>Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Good</strong>: Evidence includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative populations.</p>
<p><strong>Fair</strong>: Evidence is sufficient to determine effects on outcomes, but the strength of the evidence is limited by the number, quality, or consistency of the individual studies.</p>
<p><strong>Poor</strong>: Evidence is insufficient to assess the effects on outcomes because of limited number or power of studies, important flaws in their design or conduct, gaps in the chain of evidence, or lack of information.</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Strong recommendation supported by the evidence</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: Recommendation supported by the evidence</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: Recommendation supported primarily by expert opinion</p>
<p><strong>Application of Recommendations</strong></p>

<p><strong>Position Development Conference (PDC) Expert Panel</strong></p>
<p>Concurrent with Task Force work, international experts in the field of bone densitometry and societies specific to skeletal health were contacted by the PDC Steering Committee to serve as member panelists. Twelve experts agreed to participate on the PDC Expert Panel. In addition to individuals representing many regions of the world, one official representative from each of the following professional societies were participants on the expert panel; The American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR), the North American Menopause Society (NAMS), and the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF). The role of the Expert Panel was to review the proposed Official Positions and supportive documents developed by the task forces and make final recommendations to the International Society for Clinical Densitometry Board of Directors (ISCD BOD).</p>
<p><strong>PDC Moderators</strong></p>
<p>PDC panel Moderators with experience in the RAND/University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Appropriateness Method (RAM) were selected by the Steering Committee. Two moderators assisted the Chair of the PDC in the development and refinement of statements derived from the initial Task Forces questions and sub-questions and, along with the Chair of the PDC, lead the discussion and the rating by the Expert Panel during the PDC in Tampa, Florida, USA.</p>
<p><strong>Grading of the Official Positions</strong></p>
<p>All Official Positions for the 2013 PDC were rated by the Expert Panel in the following categories: appropriateness, necessity, quality of evidence, strength of recommendations and application of recommendations (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; and the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field).</p>
<p>Proposed ratings in all cases, except the RAM ratings for appropriateness and necessity for each of the above categories, were included in the preliminary Official Positions crafted by each Task Force. Final ratings were determined by the on site meeting, convened Expert Panel that included appropriateness and necessity.</p>
<p>A rating of &quot;appropriate&quot; was required in order for a statement to be sent to the BOD for selection as an ISCD Official Position. Ratings of each Official Position from the 2013 PDC are expressed in the form of four characters representing quality of the evidence, strength of the recommendation, application of the recommendation, and whether it is necessary as previously described. For example, a rating &quot;Good-A-W-Necessary&quot; indicates that the evidence includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative populations, a strong recommendation supported by the evidence, worldwide recommendation, and is necessary to perform in all instances. Since PDC topics are often selected because strong medical evidence is unavailable, it is the nature of the process that Official Positions are not always supported by the highest possible level of evidence. Nevertheless, the ISCD Official Positions encourage consistent approaches in the clinical practice of bone densitometry, and focus attention on issues that require further study.</p>
<p><strong>PDC Procedures</strong></p>
<p>After the initial selection of topics by the Board of Directors and Scientific Advisory Committee, the PDC Steering Committee selected three Task Force chairpersons, one for each of the three major PDC topics. Thereafter, the PDC Steering Committee and Task Force chairpersons worked collectively to select international experts as members of their respective Task Forces with the knowledge required to evaluate their assigned PDC topic. All topic questions and sub-questions that were generated by each Task Force were thoroughly researched in the scientific medical literature.</p>
<p>Prior to the PDC meeting in Tampa, Florida, USA, topic questions and sub-questions were converted into recommendation statements that were sent to the Expert Panel for an initial &quot;appropriateness&quot; rating. The PDC required a median &quot;appropriateness&quot; rating in either the upper third or lower third of the rating continuum (continuum was 1 to 9 with clusters 7 to 9 representing the upper third and clusters 1 to 3 representing the lower third) without &quot;disagreement.&quot; &quot;Disagreement&quot; was defined as lack of consensus being predetermined to be four or more Expert Panelists rating in extreme clusters 1 to 3 and 7 to 9. In circumstances where the median &quot;appropriateness&quot; rating was less than 7, no Official Position was developed.</p>
<p>In making its decisions, the Expert Panel considered the level of the medical evidence, expert opinion, and the clinical need for a recommendation. In some instances, regulatory issues received consideration. The statements rated as &quot;appropriate&quot; with a median score of 7 or higher without &quot;disagreement&quot; by the Expert Panel were designated Official Positions. The statements rated as &quot;uncertain&quot; with a median score between four and six or any median score with &quot;disagreement&quot; were further discussed at the PDC. After the initial rating the documents supporting all Task Forces' recommendations were sent to the Expert Panelists for review. In brief, Task Force chairs presented reports on their topics supporting the &quot;uncertain&quot; statements to the Expert Panelists in closed session on the first day of the conference. These statements were then edited by Task Force chairs, if necessary, reflecting suggestions made by the Expert Panelists. Re-rating of &quot;uncertain&quot; statements occurred during each Task Force chairpersons' presentation when the PDC Moderators felt there was a significant likelihood of change in the opinions of the Expert Panel.</p>
<p>After all statements rated as &quot;appropriate without disagreement&quot; had been selected and all supporting evidence presented, the Expert Panel performed a final rating for necessity, quality of the evidence, strength of the recommendation, and application of the recommendation. The proposed Official Positions with supportive evidence were presented by the Task Force chairs at a meeting open to the public (in conjunction with the ISCD Annual Meeting) and attended by ISCD members, representatives from companies with interests in bone health and skeletal assessment, and other individuals with interest in bone disease and densitometry. All participants were encouraged to provide comments and suggestions to the expert panelists. On the next day, the Expert Panelists, in closed session, determined final wording of the proposed Official Positions.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Specific Methodology for this Guideline</strong></span></p>
<p>The Task Force was asked to address 5 issues, initially formulated as questions. Because the research and development process requires a statement to be discussed and approved, the questions were reformulated as statements. To preserve the atmosphere of the Task Force deliberations and what was presented to the Expert Panel, both the questions assigned to the Task Force and the statements reformulated by the Task Force were included in the materials presented to the Expert Panel. Because the Expert Panel decided to keep the status quo (continue to use the manufacturers' databases for spine and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES] III for hip), it did not address the question, in the event that a change was recommended, whether should it be to NHANES 2005-2010 or 2005-2008.</p>
<p>The Task Force members met briefly face-to-face, had 1 or more conference calls, and extensive email correspondence. Several straw votes were taken on the issues, and the questions were transformed to positive or negative statements based on the feelings of the Task Force members (for or against). The Task Force chair drafted the manuscript that was circulated and revised several times. Material was sought from NHANES and bone densitometry manufacturers. Numbers in the tables were prepared by the Task Force chair and rechecked by Task Force members, a NHANES representative, and representatives of the manufacturers. Except for the issue of which database to use for men, these decisions are mainly arbitrary, based on logic, not evidence.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>All Official Positions for the 2013 Position Development Conference were rated by the Expert Panel in the following categories:</p>
<p><strong>Appropriateness</strong>: Statements that the Expert Panel rated as &quot;appropriate without disagreement&quot; according to predefined criteria derived from the RAND/University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Appropriateness Method (RAM) were referred to the International Society for Clinical Densitometry Board of Directors (ISCD BOD) with a recommendation to become ISCD Official Positions. A statement was defined as &quot;appropriate&quot; when the expected health benefit exceeded the expected negative consequences by a significant margin such that it was worth performing.</p>
<p><strong>Necessity</strong>: Recommended Official Positions that were rated by the Expert Panel were then rated according to necessity to perform in all circumstances, i.e., whether the health benefits outweighed the risks to such an extent that it must be offered to all patients. Necessity rating was conducted in a similar fashion as the appropriateness rating, in that each Official Position had to be rated as necessary without disagreement using similar predefined RAM criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Strong recommendation supported by the evidence</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: Recommendation supported by the evidence</p>
