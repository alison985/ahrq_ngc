	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

ArchiveBot's source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot">https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Summary of Literature Review</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction/Background</strong></p>
<p>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) consists of both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) and is associated with significant morbidity. The incidence of VTE is approximately 100/100,000 population each year in the United States. The risk proportionately increases with age and ranges from 5/100,000 for people &amp;lt;15 years old to 500/100,000 for people &amp;gt;80 years old. The major risk factors associated with VTE were described by Virchow: hypercoagulability, endothelial injury, and stasis. The most frequent risk factors include surgery, trauma, hip fracture, prolonged immobility, and several inherited and acquired hematological conditions. Full-dose anticoagulation is the standard therapy for VTE, both for the acute and the long-term phase. The latest guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians recommend treatment with a full dose of unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight-heparin, fondaparinux, vitamin K antagonist, or thrombolysis for most patients with objectively confirmed VTE. Although anticoagulation effectively prevents thrombus extension, PE, death, and recurrence, many patients develop venous dysfunction resulting in post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). This syndrome is characterized by pain, swelling, a heavy sensation, edema, pigmentation, and ulceration in severe cases. The most severe PTS morbidity occurs in patients with iliofemoral DVT.</p>
<p><strong>Initial Treatment of Acute DVT of the Lower Extremity</strong></p>
<p>Anticoagulation is the standard initial therapy for acute DVT. The main objective in the initial treatment of DVT is to prevent thrombus extension and recurrence. The evidence for the need for anticoagulation in patients with acute DVT is based on studies performed several years ago. The first trial comparing anticoagulation versus no anticoagulation in patients with VTE was published in 1960. This study showed that treatment with heparin and a vitamin K antagonist markedly reduced recurrent PE and mortality. Other studies have shown reduced mortality in patients when heparin is used to treat VTE compared to patients who did not receive anticoagulation. In addition, a randomized controlled study reported a three-fold increase in the rate of recurrent VTE in patients treated with a vitamin K antagonist alone versus those initially treated with heparin and converted to a vitamin K antagonist. In regards to duration of initial heparin therapy, 2 randomized clinical trials for patients with proximal DVT reported that intravenous unfractionated heparin administered for 5 to 7 days is as effective as 10 to 14 days, providing that it is followed by adequate long-term anticoagulant therapy. This shorter duration of heparin therapy may also help reduce the incidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. The currently recommended approach is to start both heparin and a vitamin K antagonist at the time of diagnosis and to discontinue heparin after 5 days, provided the international normalized ratio is &amp;ge;2.0 for at least 24 hours. Multiple anticoagulation regimens are recommended to treat VTE and are beyond the scope of this document.</p>
<p><strong>Early Thrombus Removal</strong></p>
<p>Although anticoagulation effectively prevents thrombus extension, PE, death, and recurrence, many patients develop venous dysfunction resulting in PTS. PTS occurs in 20% to 50% of patients after acute DVT, and leg ulceration can occur in as many as 10% of patients. PTS can lead to disability and reduced quality of life with important clinical and public health implications. Oral anticoagulation reduces thrombus propagation but does not effectively produce clot lysis, which can result in incomplete prevention of PTS. Patients with iliofemoral DVT are the subset of patients with the largest thrombus burden and the highest risk for post-thrombotic morbidity; up to 75% have chronic painful edema, and 40% have venous claudication when treated with anticoagulant therapy alone. Treatments that actively remove thrombus have the potential to reduce the risk of developing PTS as well as relieve the immediate symptoms of DVT. The effectiveness of systemic thrombolysis to achieve early clot lysis has been investigated in a number of trials that found it to be associated with high rates of bleeding complications with relatively modest rates of thrombus clearance. The rationale for catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) is that rapid lysis is achieved with lower doses of thrombolytic agent, resulting in fewer serious bleeding complications. In the National Venous Registry, patients treated with short-term DVT (&amp;lt;10 days) had better outcomes than those with older clots who underwent correction of underlying venous lesions after successful thrombolysis. The addition of mechanical thrombus fragmentation during CDT is commonly used as part of the procedure. This is termed pharmacomechanical thrombolysis. Retrospective analyses comparing CDT alone versus pharmacomechanical thrombolysis suggest they are associated with similar rates of successful thrombolysis and major bleeding; however, pharmacomechanical thrombolysis was associated with shorter treatment times, shorter intensive care unit (ICU)/hospital stays, and reduced costs. Furthermore, the CaVenT study was a prospective randomized controlled trial that evaluated the effects of additional CDT in patients with acute DVT in regards to PTS. This study demonstrated a clinically significant reduction of PTS after additional CDT was performed compared with conventional treatment alone.</p>
<p><strong>Indications for Thrombolytic Therapy</strong></p>
<p>Although a definitive multicenter randomized controlled trial has yet to be completed, the available evidence favors use of CDT and pharmacomechanical thrombolysis in DVT patients with clinically severe manifestations of DVT. These severe manifestations include phlegmasia cerulea dolens (PCD), acute inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis, and rapid thrombus extension despite anticoagulation as well as anatomically extensive DVT that includes the common femoral and/or iliac vein since this degree of thrombus carries a higher risk of recurrent DVT and PTS.</p>
<p><strong>Acute Iliofemoral Deep Vein Thrombosis</strong></p>
<p>Recommendations for early thrombus removal are based on balancing the benefits of preventing PTS versus the risks of therapy (e.g., bleeding, recurrent DVT). A recent meta-analysis evaluating treatment options for iliofemoral DVT revealed a statistically significant reduction in the risk of PTS and venous obstruction in patients treated with CDT versus those treated with anticoagulation alone. The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and the American Venous Forum (AVF) have also recently published joint clinical practice guidelines for early thrombus removal in patients with acute iliofemoral DVT. They recommend early thrombus removal in patients who present with acute iliofemoral DVT, symptoms &amp;lt;14 days, low risk of bleeding, and a reasonable life expectancy. The 14 day cut off is somewhat arbitrary, however among the patients enrolled in the National Venous Registry, patients with DVT and symptoms &amp;gt;10 days had significantly worse outcomes than patients with symptoms &amp;lt;10 days. Other guidelines have suggested that DVT associated with symptoms &amp;le;14 days should be considered acute, and a recently published randomized trial included patients with symptoms &amp;lt;21 days.</p>
<p><strong>Phlegmasia Cerulea Dolens</strong></p>
<p>PCD is characterized by massive swelling, cyanosis, and pain resulting from extensive thrombosis of the iliofemoral venous system. Venous gangrene occurs when extensive thrombus leads to venous hypertension and small arterial collapse due to the surrounding tissue pressure. Calf compartment pressures of &amp;ge;50 mm Hg have been documented in association with PCD. Since this is a potentially life- and limb-threatening condition, the benefits of early thrombus removal outweigh the risks in this clinical scenario.</p>
<p><strong>May-Thurner Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>May-Thurner syndrome is characterized by compression of the left common iliac vein between the right common iliac artery and vertebrae. This compression is thought to induce endothelial irritation and lead to left lower extremity DVT. The importance of underlying iliac vein lesions cannot be fully appreciated in patients treated with anticoagulation alone. As early thrombus removal techniques have advanced, it has become clear that underlying iliac vein lesions, in this case compression, may contribute to many cases of iliofemoral DVT. In the National Venous Registry, 33% of limbs required treatment with stents, and the 1-year patency (74%) was significantly better in those limbs compared to the limbs without stent placement (53%; P&amp;lt;.001).</p>
<p><strong>Pharmacomechanical Thrombolysis Devices</strong></p>
<p>There are 2 most commonly used devices for pharmacomechanical thrombolysis. The first is a device that uses high-velocity saline jets for the percutaneous break-up and removal of thrombus. This device also has a &quot;power pulse&quot; function allowing additional thrombolytic penetration into the thrombus. The second device utilizes a macerating wire to break up the thrombus while thrombolytic. It consists of a catheter for infusion of fluids into a treatment area isolated between 2 occluding balloons. These devices are currently incorporated in the ATTRACT study (Acute Venous Thrombus Removal with Adjunctive Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis), which is a randomized controlled trial evaluating subsequent PTS in patients with acute DVT treated with pharmacomechanical thrombolysis plus standard anticoagulation versus anticoagulation alone in the treatment of acute DVT.</p>
<p><strong>Surgical Thrombectomy</strong></p>
<p>Venous thrombectomy has been compared with anticoagulation in the past and has been demonstrated to potentially preserve the venous function. One meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of anticoagulation, surgical thrombectomy, and CDT was recently published and found that both surgical thrombectomy and CDT decrease the incidence of PTS. The SVS/AVF guidelines recommend surgical venous thrombectomy in patients who are candidates for anticoagulation but in whom thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated. For patients who are candidates for either approach, a higher value is placed on avoiding the more invasive procedure and the potential surgical complications.</p>
<p><strong>Patient Selection</strong></p>
<p>Patient selection for CDT is individualized. Important considerations include the patient's bleeding risk profile, life expectancy, anticipated activity level, and their willingness to undergo a procedure that may require an overnight hospital stay. Successful thrombolysis is most likely achieved in patients with recently formed thrombus and symptom duration less than 10 to 14 days. Patients who have short life expectancy, do not ambulate, have had recent surgery or trauma, have intracranial lesions, and have thrombocytopenia are poor candidates.</p>
<p><strong>Compression Stockings</strong></p>
<p>The role of compression stockings in the management of chronic venous disorders has been well established. Compression stockings improve the calf muscle pump function and reduce edema. The use of graded elastic compression stockings decreases by 50% the incidence of objectively defined PTS after a first episode of proximal DVT treated with conventional anticoagulation. For this reason, the SVS/AVF guidelines recommend 30&amp;ndash;40 mm Hg compression stockings for 2 years following early thrombus removal.</p>

<p>Staff will search in PubMed only for peer reviewed medical literature for routine searches. Any article or guideline may be used by the author in the narrative but those materials may have been identified outside of the routine literature search process.</p>
<p>The Medline literature search is based on keywords provided by the topic author. The two general classes of keywords are those related to the condition (e.g., ankle pain, fever) and those that describe the diagnostic or therapeutic intervention of interest (e.g., mammography, MRI).</p>
<p>The search terms and parameters are manipulated to produce the most relevant, current evidence to address the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria (ACR AC) topic being reviewed or developed. Combining the clinical conditions and diagnostic modalities or therapeutic procedures narrows the search to be relevant to the topic. Exploding the term &quot;diagnostic imaging&quot; captures relevant results for diagnostic topics.</p>
<p>The following criteria/limits are used in the searches.</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Articles that have abstracts available and are concerned with humans. </li>
    <li>Restrict the search to the year prior to the last topic update or in some cases the author of the topic may specify which year range to use in the search. For new topics, the year range is restricted to the last 10 years unless the topic author provides other instructions. </li>
    <li>May restrict the search to Adults only or Pediatrics only. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Rating Appropriateness</strong></p>
<p>The appropriateness ratings for each of the procedures included in the Appropriateness Criteria topics are determined using a modified Delphi methodology. A series of surveys are conducted to elicit each panelist's expert interpretation of the evidence, based on the available data, regarding the appropriateness of an imaging or therapeutic procedure for a specific clinical scenario. American College of Radiology (ACR) staff distribute surveys to the panelists along with the evidence table and narrative. Each panelist interprets the available evidence and rates each procedure. The surveys are completed by panelists without consulting other panelists. The appropriateness rating scale is an ordinal scale that uses integers from 1 to 9 grouped into three categories: 1, 2, or 3 are in the category &quot;usually not appropriate&quot;; 4, 5, or 6 are in the category &quot;may be appropriate&quot;; and 7, 8, or 9 are in the category &quot;usually appropriate.&quot; Each panel member assigns one rating for each procedure for a clinical scenario. The ratings assigned by each panel member are presented in a table displaying the frequency distribution of the ratings without identifying which members provided any particular rating.</p>
<p>If consensus is reached, the median rating is assigned as the panel's final recommendation/rating. Consensus is defined as eighty percent (80%) agreement within a rating category. A maximum of three rounds may be conducted to reach consensus. Consensus among the panel members must be achieved to determine the final rating for each procedure.</p>
<p>If consensus is not reached, the panel is convened by conference call. The strengths and weaknesses of each imaging procedure that has not reached consensus are discussed and a final rating is proposed. If the panelists on the call agree, the rating is proposed as the panel's consensus. The document is circulated to all the panelists to make the final determination. If consensus cannot be reached on the call or when the document is circulated, &quot;No consensus&quot; appears in the rating column and the reasons for this decision are added to the comment sections.</p>
<p>This modified Delphi method enables each panelist to express individual interpretations of the evidence and his or her expert opinion without excessive influence from fellow panelists in a simple, standardized and economical process. A more detailed explanation of the complete process can be found in additional methodology documents found on the <a href=&quot;http://www.acr.org/ac&quot; title=&quot;ACR Web site&quot;>ACR Web site</a> (see also the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p></div>"/>
