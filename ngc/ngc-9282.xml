<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Priority placed upon available systematic reviews in literature searches. </li>
    <li>All existing Class A (randomized controlled trials [RCTs]) studies have been considered as high quality evidence unless specified differently by a work group member. </li>
    <li>All existing Class B, C and D studies have been considered as low quality evidence unless specified differently by a work group member. </li>
    <li>All existing Class M and R studies are identified by study design versus assigning a quality of evidence. Refer to Crosswalk between ICSI Evidence Grading System and GRADE (see below in the &quot;Definitions&quot; section). </li>
    <li>All new literature considered by the work group for this revision has been assessed using GRADE methodology. </li>

    <p>Eliciting symptoms should emphasize characterizing the current classification scheme that describes frequency per week, changes in physical activity, diurnal variation, and seasonal variation. It is important to recognize that patients with asthma are heterogeneous, falling into every age group, from infancy to older age, and presenting a spectrum of signs and symptoms that vary in degree and severity from patient to patient as well as within an individual patient over time <em>[Guideline]</em>.</p>

    <p>Spirometry is the cornerstone of the laboratory evaluation that enables the clinician to demonstrate airflow obstruction and establish a diagnosis of asthma with certainty. Spirometry is essential for assessing the severity of asthma in order to make appropriate therapeutic recommendations. The use of objective measures of lung function is recommended because patient-reported symptoms often do not correlate with the variability and severity of airflow obstruction. Testing should be performed in compliance with the American Thoracic Society standards. Obstructive and restrictive ventilatory defects can generally be determined using FEV<sub>1</sub>/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>.</p>
    <p>Spirometry is generally valuable in children 5 years of age or older; however, some children cannot conduct the maneuver, depending on developmental ability. Spirometry measurements (FEV<sub>1</sub>, FVC, and FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC) before or after the patient inhales a short-acting bronchodilator should be undertaken for patients in whom the diagnosis of asthma is being considered. Airflow obstruction is indicated by reduced FEV<sub>1</sub> and FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC values relative to reference or predicted values. Significant reversibility is indicated by an increase of 12 percent or greater and 200 mL in FEV<sub>1</sub> after inhaling a short-acting bronchodilator.</p>
    <p>Diagnostic spirometry and a methacholine challenge test, if necessary, are important to clinching the diagnosis. The patient's history and response to therapy should guide other diagnostic tests when considering alternative diagnoses. Follow-up spirometry every one to two years in mild asthmatics will reconfirm the diagnosis and objectify serial change and level of control. More frequent monitoring should be considered for the moderate and severe persistent categories.</p>
    <p>Investigation into the role of allergy, at least with a complete history, should be done in every patient, given high prevalence of positive skin tests among individuals with asthma and the benefits of limiting exposure to known allergens. History may help to distinguish seasonal allergies but may be inadequate for perennial allergies. Eosinophil count and IgE may be elevated in asthma; however, neither test has sufficient specificity or sensitivity to be used alone in a diagnosis. The chest x-ray and electrocardiogram are usually normal in asthma but may be useful to exclude other pulmonary or cardiac conditions. Sputum examination may be helpful if sputum eosinophilia or infection are suspected.</p>
    <p>Exhaled nitric oxide is a newly available quantitative, non-invasive measure of airway inflammation that is another tool to assess airway disease. The early use will be by asthma specialists rather than primary care. It can be useful in the diagnosis of eosinophilic airway inflammation as well as determining the likelihood of response to corticosteroid treatment, monitoring the airway to determine if additional anti-inflammatory is needed, and assisting in evaluating adherence to anti-inflammatory medication. The American Thoracic Society has published a clinical practice guideline: &quot;Interpretation of Exhaled Nitric Oxide Levels for Clinical Application&quot; <em>[Guideline]</em>.</p>
    <p>There are several clinical scenarios in children that have a frequent association with asthma and should strongly suggest asthma as a possible diagnosis. These include recurrent pulmonary infiltrates (especially right middle lobe infiltrates) with volume loss that clear radiologically within two to three days, and the diagnosis of pneumonia without fever. Asthma may cause radiologic uncertainty since mucus plugging and atelectasis may be interpreted as infiltrates.</p>

    <li><strong>Acute Asthma Exacerbation?</strong>
    <p>Symptoms of an acute asthma episode include progressive breathlessness, cough, wheezing, or chest tightness. An acute asthma episode is characterized by a decrease in expiratory airflow that can be documented and quantified by measurement of lung function (spirometry or PEFR). Indications for emergency care include:</p>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>

    <p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Treatment is begun with inhaled short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists administered by metered dose inhaler (MDI)/spacer or nebulizer. </li>

    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>PEFR or FEV<sub>1</sub> greater than or equal to 70% predicted normal </li>
        <li>No wheezing on auscultation </li>

<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;10&quot;>
    <li><strong>Does Patient Need ED or Inpatient Asthma Management?</strong>
    <p>Studies suggest that most children who require hospitalization can be identified by a repeat assessment one hour after initial treatment <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>. After one hour, those children who continue to meet the criteria for a severe exacerbation have a greater than 86% chance of requiring hospitalization; those who meet the criteria for moderate exacerbation at one hour have an 84% chance of requiring hospitalization; and those whose assessment has remained the same or dropped to the mild level have only an 18% chance of requiring hospitalization. These severity assessment studies highlight the importance of regular, multifaceted assessments and close observation of children and adolescents who present to the office or ED with acute asthma exacerbations <em>[Guideline]</em>.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;11&quot;>
    <li><strong>Evaluation</strong>
    <p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
    <p>Evaluation of asthma should include the following:</p>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Medical history </li>
        <li>Use of a validated asthma questionnaire. Three validated tools are Asthma Control Test (ACT), Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) and Asthma Therapy Assessment Questionnaire (ATAQ). </li>
        <li>Assess indoor and outdoor asthma triggers/allergens </li>
        <li>Physical examination </li>
        <li>Measure lung function </li>
        <li>Consider specialty consultation </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Medical History</strong></p>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Disruption of usual activities (work, school, home) </li>
        <li>Sleep disturbance </li>
        <li>Level of usage of short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonist </li>
        <li>Adherence to medical treatment plan </li>
        <li>Interval exacerbation of symptoms (either treated by self or a health care provider) </li>
        <li>Symptoms suggesting comorbid conditions or alternative diagnosis </li>
        <li>Side effects of medications </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Reassessment of medical history can elicit factors that affect overall asthma control and sense of well-being <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>. The key symptoms that should alert the clinician include disruptive daytime symptoms and disturbances of sleep, and symptoms early in the morning that do not improve 15 minutes after using short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonist. The quantity of short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonist that is being used should be discussed since overuse can be a marker of the potentially fatality-prone asthmatic <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>. The use of a quality of life tool or questionnaire can assist to elicit history <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Use of a Validated Asthma Questionnaire</strong></p>
    <p>The self-assessment questionnaires that can be completed at office visits are intended to capture the patient's and family's impression of asthma control, self-management skills, and overall satisfaction with care. Three multidimensional instruments have been developed and validated for assessment and monitoring of asthma. They are the Asthma Control Test (ACT), Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) and Asthma Therapy Assessment Questionnaire (ATAQ). Only the ACT has been validated for use with children ages 4 to 11. See <a href=&quot;http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/asthma/04_sec3_comp.pdf&quot; title=&quot;NHLBI Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/asthma/index.htm</a> (Accessed April 24, 2012) <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Assess Asthma Triggers/Allergens</strong></p>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Inquire about exposure to triggers and allergens (e.g., occupational, pets, smoke). </li>
        <li>Allergy testing is recommended for patients with persistent asthma who are exposed to perennial indoor allergens. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Studies of emergency department visits and near death show allergens as a factor in asthma exacerbation. Asthma triggers in the workplace also need to be considered. About 15% of asthma in adults is work related <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Physical Examination</strong></p>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Assess signs associated with asthma, concurrent illness, or medication side effects </li>
        <li>Height in children </li>
        <li>Head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, skin </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is important to discuss any potential medication side effects as this often has a direct relationship to compliance. See Annotation #14, &quot;Asthma Education,&quot; for more guidance on side effects.</p>
    <p>The remainder of the physical exam either supports or refutes conditions and comorbidities discussed above (see history).</p>
    <p><strong>Measure Lung Function</strong></p>
    <p>It is important to measure lung function at each asthma-related visit. The two main methods are spirometry and PEFR. Spirometry is more precise and yields more information than PEFR. It is helpful to verify the accuracy of the peak flow meter. It is useful when certain physical limitations affect accuracy of PEFR (example: very young or elderly, neuromuscular or orthopedic problems) <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>.</p>
    <p>Spirometry is recommended:</p>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>For initial diagnosis or to reassess or confirm diagnosis </li>
        <li>After treatment is initiated or changed, and once symptoms and PEFR have stabilized to document attainment of &quot;near normal pulmonary function&quot; </li>
        <li>At least every 1 to 2 years to assess maintenance of airway function; more often as severity indicates. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Regular monitoring of pulmonary function is particularly important for asthma patients who do not perceive their symptoms until obstruction is severe <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>.</p>
    <p>PEFR:</p>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Used for follow-up, not for diagnosis </li>
    </ul>
    <p>PEFR provides a simple, quantitative, and reproductive measure of severity of airflow obstruction. The results are more reliable if the same type of meter, and preferably the patient's own, is used.</p>
    <p>During interval assessment, the clinician should question the patient and review records to evaluate the frequency, severity, and causes of exacerbation. Triggers that may contribute should be reviewed. All patients on chronic maintenance medication should be questioned about exposure to inhalant allergens.</p>
    <p><strong>Consider Specialty Consultation</strong></p>
    <p>Referral is recommended for consultation or care to a specialist in asthma care (allergist or pulmonologist, or other physicians who have expertise in asthma management, developed through additional training and experience) <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em> when:</p>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Patient has had a life-threatening asthma exacerbation. </li>
        <li>Patient is not meeting the goals of asthma therapy after 3 to 6 months of treatment. An earlier referral or consultation is appropriate if the physician concludes that the patient is unresponsive to therapy. </li>
        <li>Signs and symptoms are atypical, or there are problems in differential diagnosis. </li>
        <li>Other conditions complicate asthma or its diagnosis (e.g., sinusitis, nasal polyps, aspergillosis, severe rhinitis, vocal cord dysfunction [VCD], GERD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]). </li>
        <li>Additional diagnostic testing is indicated (e.g., allergy skin testing, rhinoscopy, complete pulmonary function studies, provocative challenge, bronchoscopy). </li>
        <li>Patient requires additional education and guidance on complications of therapy, problems with adherence, or allergen avoidance. </li>
        <li>Patient is being considered for immunotherapy. </li>
        <li>Patient requires step 4 care or higher. Consider referral if patient requires step 3 care. </li>
        <li>Patient has required more than two bursts of oral corticosteroids in one year or has an exacerbation requiring hospitalization. </li>
        <li>Patient requires confirmation of a history that suggests that an occupational or environmental inhalant or ingested substance is provoking or contributing to asthma. Depending on the complexities of diagnosis, treatment or the intervention required in the work environment, it may be appropriate in some cases for the specialist to manage the patient over a period of time or to co-manage with the primary care physician (PCP). </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;12&quot;>
    <li><strong>Determine Level of Asthma Control</strong>
    <p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Clinicians should assign a level of control based on the most severe impairment or risk category of the patient. </li>
        <li>Clinicians should assign the level of asthma control (well controlled, not well controlled, or poorly controlled) based on the degree to which both dimensions of the manifestations of asthma&amp;mdash;impairment and risk&amp;mdash;are minimized by therapeutic intervention. </li>
        <li>Clinicians should determine their clinical actions (i.e., whether to maintain or adjust therapy) based on the level of control at the patient's follow-up assessment. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>See Table 5, &quot;Assessing Asthma Control in Children 5-11 Years of Age,&quot; and Table 6, &quot;Assessing Asthma Control in Youths 12 Years of Age through Adults,&quot; in the original guideline document.</p>

    <li><strong>Step Care of Pharmacologic Treatment</strong>
    <p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Clinicians should follow the stepwise approach in asthma management therapy. </li>
        <li>Clinicians should use inhaled corticosteroids as the preferred treatment over leukotriene receptor antagonists in mild persistent asthma in adults and children. </li>
        <li>Clinicians should order annual influenza vaccination for patients with persistent asthma. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The aim of asthma therapy is to maintain control of asthma with the least amount of medication and hence minimize the risk for adverse effects. The stepwise approach to therapy, in which the dose and number of medications and frequency of administration are increased as necessary and decreased when possible, is used to achieve this control. Since asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways with recurrent exacerbations, therapy for persistent asthma emphasizes efforts to suppress inflammation over the long term and prevent exacerbations. See tables below for management approach for asthma.</p>
    <p>Based on data comparing leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) to inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred treatment option for mild persistent asthma in adults and children. LTRAs are an alternative, although not preferred, treatment <em>[Guideline]</em>, <em>[High Quality Evidence]</em>, <em>[Systematic Review]</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Vaccinations</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Annual influenza vaccinations are recommended for patients with persistent asthma <em>[Reference]</em>. Asthma is an independent risk factor for invasive pneumococcal disease <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that persons aged 19 through 64 years who have asthma should receive a single dose of pneumococcal vaccine (PPSV23) (see <a href=&quot;http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/keyfacts.htm&quot; title=&quot;CDC Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/keyfacts.htm</a>.

    <li><strong>Asthma Education</strong>
    <p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Clinicians must provide self-management education to give patients the skills necessary to control asthma and improve outcomes. When working with adult asthmatics, this education should include a written asthma action plan, patient self-monitoring and regular clinician follow-up <em>[Systematic Review]</em>. </li>
        <li>Clinicians should integrate asthma self-management education into all aspects of asthma care, as it requires repetition and reinforcement <em>[Guideline]</em>. </li>
        <li>A collaborative approach toward shared decision-making should always be undertaken (Refer to Appendix F, &quot;ICSI Shared Decision-Making Model,&quot; in the original guideline document). </li>
        <li>Discuss all potential side effects. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Asthma self-management should:</p>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Begin at the time of diagnosis and continue through follow-up care. </li>
        <li>Involve all members of the health care team. </li>
        <li>Introduce the key educational messages by the principal clinician, and negotiate agreements about the goals of treatment, specific medications, and the actions patients will take to reach the agreed-upon goals to control asthma. </li>
        <li>Reinforce and expand key messages (e.g., the patient's level of asthma control, inhaler techniques, self-monitoring, and use of a written asthma action plan) by all members of the health care team. </li>
        <li>Occur at all points of care where health professionals interact with patients who have asthma, including clinics, medical offices, emergency departments and hospitals, pharmacies, homes and community sites (e.g., schools, community centers). </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Regular review, by an informed clinician, of the status of the patient's asthma control is an essential part of asthma self-management education. Teach and reinforce at <strong>every</strong> opportunity.</p>
    <p>Supervised self-management (using patient education and adjustments of anti-inflammatory medication based on PEFR or symptoms coupled with regular medical review, utilization of adherence to medication) reduces asthma morbidity. This reduction includes lost work days, unscheduled office visits, and ED and hospital admissions <em>[Systematic Review]</em>, <em>[High Quality Evidence]</em>.</p>
    <p>Refer to the original guideline document for additional information on asthma education including basic facts about asthma; how medications work (including potential side effects of inhaled steroids and beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists [see also &quot;Potential Harms&quot; field]); inhaler technique; environmental control measures; written asthma action plan; need for adherence, and developing an active partnership with the patient and family.</p>
    <p>A sample asthma action plan is attached in Appendix E of the original guideline document.</p>

<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;15&quot;>
    <li><strong>Schedule Regular Follow-up Visits</strong>
    <p>Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease, and all chronic diseases need regular follow-up visits. Practitioners need to assess whether or not control of asthma has been maintained and if a step down in therapy is appropriate. Further, practitioners need to monitor and review the daily self-management and action plans, the medications, and the patient's inhaler and peak flow monitoring techniques. The exact frequency of visits is a matter of clinical judgment. If asthma is uncontrolled or a change in medication or clinical status has occurred, the patient should be followed in 2 to 6 weeks for an evaluation. A stable asthma patient should be followed at regular intervals of 1 to 6 months.</p>

        <li>Systemic corticosteroids should be used for all patients who do not favorably respond to the initial beta<sub>2</sub>-agonist therapy. </li>
        <li>Anticholinergic therapy may increase lung function and may decrease hospital admission rate. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Corticosteroids</strong></p>
    <p>Parenteral and enteral administration of corticosteroids requires about 6 to 24 hours to be effective. Intravenous (IV) and oral routes of corticosteroid administration appear to be equivalent <em>[High Quality Evidence]</em>. Medium to high doses of corticosteroids appear to be better than low doses; however, there is still a large range, roughly 160 mg methylprednisolone per day or 2 mg/kg/day in children. There is no evidence to support very high doses of steroids <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>, <em>[High Quality Evidence]</em>. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines recommend that patients admitted to the hospital should receive IV or oral steroids <em>[Guideline]</em>.</p>
    <p>There may be a role for inhaled high-dose corticosteroids in the emergency department in addition to the IV or oral route; however, the data do not support this as standard of care at this time <em>[High Quality Evidence]</em>, <em>[Systematic Review]</em>.</p>
    <p>In adult asthmatic cases where intolerance or non-compliance with oral steroid therapy is a concern, consider the use of intramuscular (IM) methylprednisolone <em>[High Quality Evidence]</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Anticholinergics</strong></p>
    <p>Inhaled ipratropium bromide: adding multiple high doses of ipratropium bromide (0.5 mg nebulizer solution or 8 puffs by MDI in adults; 0.25 to 0.5 mg nebulizer solution or 4 to 8 puffs by MDI in children) to a selective short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonist produces additional bronchodilation, resulting in fewer hospital admissions, particularly in patients who have severe airflow obstruction <em>[High Quality Evidence]</em>, <em>[Systematic Review]</em>.</p>

    <li><strong>Treatment (Poor Response)</strong>
    <p>See Appendix A, &quot;Dosages of Drugs for Asthma Exacerbations in the Emergency Medical Care or Hospital,&quot; in the original guideline document.</p>
    <p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>There is no clinical advantage to continuous versus intermittent nebulization of albuterol in the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations <em>[High Quality Evidence]</em>, <em>[Systematic Review]</em>. </li>
        <li>Clinicians should consider bi-level positive airway pressure for patients with severe asthma exacerbations as this may prevent mechanical intubations <em>[High Quality Evidence]</em>. </li>
        <li>Clinicians may consider heliox as secondary therapy in asthma patients who do not respond to first-line therapies <em>[Systematic Review]</em>. </li>
        <li>Clinicians may consider ketamine for use in severe asthma exacerbations <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>. </li>
        <li>Clinicians should consider the use of magnesium sulfate in the treatment of severe acute asthma <em>[Meta-analysis]</em>, <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>, <em>[High Quality Evidence]</em>, <em>[Systematic Review]</em>. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Intermittent Nebulization versus Continuous Nebulization</strong></p>
    <p>Intermittent nebulization versus continuous nebulization in the treatment of acute asthma has been evaluated quite extensively. The data would suggest that these treatments are equally efficacious; however, there may be a trend toward improvement in patients with severe asthma using continuous nebulization. In a subgroup analysis of patients whose initial FEV<sub>1</sub> was less than 50% predicted, there was a statistically significant improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> in patients treated with continuous nebulization versus intermittent nebulization <em>[High Quality Evidence]</em>. Similarly, in another subgroup analysis of patients whose initial PEFR was less than 200, there was a statistically significant improvement in PEFR and a decrease in hospital admissions in patients treated with continuous versus intermittent nebulization <em>[High Quality Evidence]</em>. However, in another subgroup of patients whose FEV<sub>1</sub> was less than 50% predicted, there was no difference in improvement in FEV<sub>1 </sub>or hospital admissions in patients treated with continuous versus intermittent nebulization<em> [High Quality Evidence]</em>.</p>
    <p>A meta-analysis suggests equivalence of continuous versus intermittent albuterol in treating asthma. This is determined by spirometry measurement and rates of admission to the hospital <em>[Meta-analysis]</em>. There does not seem to be any advantage of higher doses of albuterol for continuous nebulization. There was no difference in lung function in patients treated with 7.5 mg or 15 mg of albuterol <em>[High Quality Evidence]</em>. Utilizing albuterol and ipratropium bromide continuously versus albuterol alone demonstrated a trend toward improvement in reducing the length of stay in the emergency department and in hospital admission rates <em>[High Quality Evidence]</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (Bi-Level PAP)</strong></p>
    <p>Bi-level PAP therapy should be considered for patients presenting with an acute asthma exacerbation. Accumulating studies have shown a benefit in using bi-level PAP for patients presenting with non-cardiogenic respiratory failure. These studies included, but were not limited to, patients with asthma exacerbations. A study <em>[High Quality Evidence]</em> compared bi-level PAP ventilation plus conventional therapy versus conventional therapy in patients presenting with an acute asthma exacerbation. Patients in the bi-level PAP group showed a statistically significant improvement in lung function (measured by FEV<sub>1</sub>), improved faster, and were less likely to require admission to the hospital and mechanical intubations.</p>
    <p><strong>Heliox</strong></p>
    <p>Heliox, a blend of helium and oxygen, is a low-density gas that has been shown in some studies to improve deposition of albuterol into distal airways when compared with nebulized albuterol with oxygen alone.</p>
    <p>There is not enough evidence from large, prospective, randomized controlled trials to recommend heliox as first-line therapy in patients with asthma exacerbations. However, it is recommended that heliox be considered <em>[Systematic Review]</em> as a secondary therapy in patients with a severe asthma exacerbation who are not responding to first-line therapies.</p>
    <p><strong>Ketamine</strong></p>
    <p>Ketamine and propofol are anesthetic agents with neuroregulatory properties resulting in bronchodilation. The use of ketamine has shown benefit in improving airway parameters <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>, but increased side effects have resulted in longer hospitalizations <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>. Increased side effects of increased secretions, dysphoria and hallucinations are noted. Clinical data suggests that in the non-intubated patient the side effects may cancel benefit. Some reported case reports suggest benefit in intubated patients <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>. Well-controlled studies are required to make a clear strong recommendation for use. Use of ketamine has been pursued only in severe asthmatic exacerbations.</p>
    <p><strong>Magnesium Sulfate</strong></p>
    <p>The efficacy of magnesium sulfate has not been consistently demonstrated in randomized control trials. It has not been demonstrated to cause any harmful effects. In a recent multi-center trial, IV magnesium sulfate improved pulmonary function only in patients with severe asthma (FEV<sub>1</sub> less than 25%). It did not shorten length of hospital stay <em>[High Quality Evidence]</em>. In a systematic review, magnesium sulfate did not demonstrate improvement in PEFR, or in hospital length of stay. However, in a subset of patients with severe asthma exacerbations, PEFR, FEV<sub>1</sub> and length of stay were improved <em>[Systematic Review]</em>.There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of IV magnesium in the emergency department setting <em>[Meta-analysis]</em>, <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>. However, since it is safe and inexpensive, it should be considered for use in patients with severe asthma exacerbations.</p>
    <p><strong>Leukotriene Modifiers</strong></p>
    <p>The evaluation of leukotriene modifiers for acute asthma care is in its infancy. Pulmonary function has been shown to improve more rapidly when a leukotriene administered orally is added to the standard therapy of asthma care (beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists/corticosteroids) in emergency department settings <em>[Cost-Effectiveness Analysis]</em>, <em>[High Quality Evidence]</em>. More studies are needed to confirm these reports.</p>
    <p>Montelukast in acute asthma management has been shown to improve pulmonary function in randomized controlled trials <em>[High Quality Evidence]</em>. However, statistical significance could not always be maintained.</p>
    <p>The evidence is too preliminary to recommend leukotriene modifiers in acute asthma exacerbations.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;29&quot;>
    <li><strong>Admit to Hospital?</strong>
    <p>Also see Annotation #10, &quot;Does Patient Need ED or Inpatient Asthma Management?&quot;</p>
    <p>The decision when to discharge from the ED or admit to the hospital must be individualized and depends on response to treatment, pulmonary function, and socioeconomic factors. It is important to consider risk factors for asthma-related death <em>[Guideline]</em>. Actual length of stay in the ED will vary; some departments have the ability for more extended treatment and observation, provided there is sufficient monitoring and nursing care.</p>
    <p>Response to initial treatment in the ED can be based on a repeat assessment approximately 60 to 90 minutes after initiating bronchodilator therapy, which is a better predictor of the need for hospitalization than is the severity of an exacerbation on presentation <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>. Evaluation includes the patient's subjective response, physical findings, O<sub>2</sub> saturation and measurement of airflow. Other aspects to consider include duration and severity of symptoms, course and severity of prior exacerbations, medications used at the time of the exacerbation, access to medical care and medications, adequacy of support and home conditions, and presence of psychiatric illness. Pretreatment O<sub>2</sub> saturation less than or equal to 70%, persisting respiratory acidosis, or severe obstruction that does not improve with the administration of sympathomimetics indicates the need for hospitalization <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>.</p>
    <p>Discharge is appropriate if FEV<sub>1</sub> or PEFR has returned to greater than or equal to 70% personal best or predicted, and symptoms are minimal or absent. Patients with an incomplete response (FEV<sub>1</sub> or PEFR 40% to 69%), and with mild symptoms should be assessed individually and may be appropriate for discharge with consideration of the above factors. It is recommended that patients with a rapid good response be observed for 30 to 60 minutes after the most recent dose of bronchodilator to ensure stability of response before being discharged home.</p>

    <li><strong>Return to Annotations #25 and #27</strong>
    <p>Patients being admitted from the ED with an acute asthma exacerbation should be reassessed shortly after admission, with special emphasis on whether the patient is showing any clinical signs of improvement or deterioration (see Annotation #5, &quot;Assess Severity of Asthma Exacerbation&quot;). Objective data should include repeating of the patient's FEV<sub>1</sub> or PEFR. A complete physical exam should include emphasis on the patient's respiratory rate, air entry on lung exam, and the presence/absence of signs of increased work of breathing, such as supraclavicular or intercostal retractions.</p>
    <p>Consider other illnesses and comorbidities. These may also cause dyspnea, chest tightness and wheezing.</p>

        <li>Inhaled beta<sub>2</sub>-agonist every 2 to 6 hours. </li>
        <li>Systemic corticosteroids are almost always the treatment of choice in patients with acute asthma exacerbation. Corticosteroids aid symptom resolution and prevent asthma relapse. </li>
        <li>Initiate or increase anti-inflammatory medication:

                <li>The role of inhaled corticosteroids after an emergency department visit is controversial <em>[Systematic Review]</em>, <em>[High Quality Evidence]</em>. However, it is the consensus of the guideline development group that inhaled corticosteroids should be encouraged at the time of discharge. </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Consider leukotriene modifiers as an additive therapy. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Antibiotics are not routinely used but may be warranted if patient has signs of acute bacterial infection, fever and purulent sputum. </li>

    <p><strong>Special Populations</strong></p>
    <p><em>Asthma in Pregnancy</em></p>
    <p>The treatment plan of asthma management in pregnancy should include reducing medication toxicity, teratogenicity and preserving uteroplacenta circulation. Changes in the mother's asthma status are expected in almost half of patients, with half of these expecting a worsening of asthma status, particularly if previous pregnancies had similar outcomes. Typical changes of pregnancy&amp;mdash;those of increased heart rate, respiratory rate and decreases in baseline CO<sub>2</sub> levels&amp;mdash;can lead to underdiagnosing asthma severity if not recognized <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>.</p>
    <p>The treatment of acute asthma in pregnancy follows the guidelines for acute asthma care, keeping in mind the goals of the management and changes in physiology.</p>
    <p>Albuterol is the preferred short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonist and has not been linked to adverse fetal outcomes in follow-up studies. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are the preferred treatment for long-term control medication. Budesonide is the preferred ICS because more data are available on using budesonide in pregnant women than are available on other ICSs, and the data are reassuring <em>[Guideline]</em>. Systemic steroids, if used in the first trimester, may, though rarely, increase the frequency of cleft palate and possibly be associated with development of preeclampsia and prematurity. However, the risk to both mother and fetus of an unmanaged severe asthmatic attack overshadows the medication observed risks <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>.</p>

<p>A literature search on diagnosing and treating asthma focused on systematic reviews in PubMed and Cochrane databases. Publication dates included November 2009 through November 2011. Limitations were human data only and English language publications. Search strategy can be seen in MeSH terms: asthma, diagnosis, therapy, therapeutics.</p>
<p>Broader searches were conducted on the use of FENO (fraction of expired nitric oxide) testing, asthma management clinics, and quality improvement programs for symptom management. Included were trial data and observational studies, guidelines and reviews. Search strategies can be seen in MeSH terms: FENO, organization and administration, disease management, symptom management, palliative care, clinics, specialty, ambulatory, guideline/meta-analysis/controlled trial/review.</p>
<p>A final search on patient education and self-management focused on both randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews in PubMed from January 2009 through March 2012. Results were limited to English language publications. Search strategy can be seen in MeSH terms: effective, patient education handout/ topic, self-management and self-monitoring.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Critical Review Process</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of critical review is to provide an opportunity for the clinicians in the member groups to review the science behind the recommendations and focus on the content of the guideline. Critical review also provides an opportunity for clinicians in each group to come to consensus on feedback they wish to give the work group and to consider changes necessary across systems in their organization to implement the guideline.</p>
<p>All member organizations are expected to respond to critical review guidelines. Critical review of guidelines is a criterion for continued membership within the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI).</p>
<p>After the critical review period, the guideline work group reconvenes to review the comments and make changes, as appropriate. The work group prepares a written response to all comments.</p>
<p><strong>Approval</strong></p>
<p>Each guideline, order set, and protocol is approved by the appropriate steering committee. There is one steering committee each for Respiratory, Cardiovascular, Women's Health, and Preventive Services. The Committee for Evidence-based Practice approves guidelines, order sets, and protocols not associated with a particular category. The steering committees review and approve each guideline based on the following:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Member comments have been addressed reasonably. </li>
    <li>There is consensus among all ICSI member organizations on the content of the document. </li>
    <li>Within the knowledge of the reviewer, the scientific recommendations within the document are current. </li>
    <li>When evidence for a particular recommendation in the guideline has not been well established, the work group identifies consensus statements that were developed based on community standard of practice and work group expert opinion. </li>
    <li>Either a critical review has been carried out, or to the extent of the knowledge of the reviewer, the changes proposed are sufficiently familiar and sufficiently agreed upon by the users that a new round of critical review is not needed. </li>
</ul>
<p>Once the guideline, order set, or protocol has been approved, it is posted on the ICSI Web site and released to members for use. Guidelines, order sets, and protocols are reviewed regularly and revised, if warranted.</p>
<p><strong>Revision Process of Existing Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>ICSI scientific documents are revised every 12 to 36 months as indicated by changes in clinical practice and literature. Every 6 months, ICSI checks with the work group to determine if there have been changes in the literature significant enough to cause the document to be revised earlier than scheduled.</p>
<p>ICSI staff working with the work group to identify any pertinent clinical trials, meta-analysis, systematic reviews, or regulatory statements and other professional guidelines conduct a literature search. The work group will meet for 1-2 three-hour meetings to review the literature, respond to member organization comments, and revise the document as appropriate.</p>
<p>A second review by members is indicated if there are changes or additions to the document that would be unfamiliar or unacceptable to member organizations. If a review by members is not needed, the document goes to the appropriate steering committee for approval according to the criteria outlined above.</p></div>"/>

    <li>Potential side effects from inhaled steroids include oral candidiasis and dysphonia. </li>
    <li>Beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists may cause tachycardia, tremor, or nervousness. </li>
    <li>Individuals on long-term oral corticosteroids or frequent bursts of steroids need to be monitored for complications of corticosteroid use such as osteoporosis, hypertension, diabetes, and Cushing's syndrome. </li>
    <li>The height of individuals on corticosteroids should be monitored over time. The potential effect on linear growth in children is important because these drugs tend to be used over long periods of time. Cumulative data in children suggest that low-to-medium doses of inhaled corticosteroids may have the potential of decreasing growth velocity, but this effect is not sustained in subsequent years of treatment, is not progressive, and may be reversible. </li>
    <li>Inhaled glucocorticoids used to treat asthma have been shown to have deleterious effects on bone mineral density and markers of bone mineral metabolism. The risk of fracture attributable to inhaled or nasal glucocorticoids is uncertain. </li>
    <li>The use of ketamine has shown increased side effects resulting in longer hospitalization. Increased secretions, dysphoria, and hallucinations are noted. Clinical data suggest that in the nonintubated patient the side effects may cancel benefit. </li>
    <li>Systemic steroids in the first trimester of pregnancy may, though rarely, increase the frequency of cleft palate and possibly be associated with development of preeclampsia and prematurity. However, the risk to both mother and fetus of an unmanaged severe asthmatic attack overshadows the medication observed risks. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Once a guideline is approved for general implementation, a medical group can choose to concentrate on the implementation of that guideline. When four or more groups choose the same guideline to implement and they wish to collaborate with others, they may form an action group.</p>
<p>In the action group, each medical group sets specific goals they plan to achieve in improving patient care based on the particular guideline(s). Each medical group shares its experiences and supporting measurement results within the action group. This sharing facilitates a collaborative learning environment. Action group learnings are also documented and shared with interested medical groups within the collaborative.</p>
<p>Currently, action groups may focus on one guideline or a set of guidelines such as hypertension, lipid treatment, and tobacco cessation.</p>
<p>Detailed measurement strategies are presented in the original guideline document to help close the gap between clinical practice and the guideline recommendations. Summaries of the measures are provided in the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC).</p>
<p><strong>Implementation Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Prior to implementation, it is important to consider current organizational infrastructure that address the following:</p>
