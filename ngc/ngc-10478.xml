	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p>Each recommendation has been mapped from the NHLBI grading format to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Class of Recommendation/Level of Evidence (ACC/AHA COR/LOE) construct and is expressed in both formats. Because of the inherent differences in grading systems and the clinical questions driving the recommendations, alignment between the NHLBI and ACC/AHA formats is in some cases imperfect. Definitions for the NHLBI strength of recommendation (<strong>A-E, N</strong>) and quality of evidence (<strong>High, Moderate, Low</strong>) and the ACC/AHA levels of the evidence (<strong>LOE: A-C</strong>) and classes of recommendations (<strong>COR: I-III</strong>) are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>

        <li>Achieve this pattern by following plans such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Pattern, or the AHA Diet. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Aim for a dietary pattern that achieves 5% to 6% of calories from saturated fat. <strong>NHLBI Grade: A (Strong); ACC/AHA COR: I; ACC/AHA LOE: A</strong> </li>
    <li>Reduce percent of calories from saturated fat. <strong>NHLBI Grade: A (Strong); ACC/AHA COR: I; ACC/AHA LOE: A</strong> </li>
    <li>Reduce percent of calories from <em>trans</em> fat. <strong>NHLBI Grade: A (Strong); ACC/AHA COR: I; ACC/AHA LOE: A</strong> </li>

    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Lower sodium intake. <strong>NHLBI Grade: A (Strong); ACC/AHA COR: I; ACC/AHA LOE: A</strong> </li>
    <li>a. Consume no more than 2,400 mg of sodium/d; b. Further reduction of sodium intake to 1,500 mg/d can result in even greater reduction in BP; and c. Even without achieving these goals, reducing sodium intake by at least 1,000 mg/d lowers BP. <strong>NHLBI Grade: B (Moderate); ACC/AHA COR: IIa; ACC/AHA LOE: B</strong> </li>
    <li>Combine the DASH dietary pattern with lower sodium intake. <strong>NHLBI Grade: A (Strong); ACC/AHA COR: I; ACC/AHA LOE: A</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Physical Activity</strong></p>
<p><em>Lipids</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>In general, advise adults to engage in aerobic physical activity to reduce LDL-C and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non&amp;ndash;HDL-C): 3&amp;ndash;4 sessions per week, lasting on average 40 minutes per session, and involving moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity. <strong>NHLBI Grade: B (Moderate); ACC/AHA COR: IIa; ACC/AHA LOE: A</strong> </li>

<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*In most cases, the strength of the recommendation should be closely aligned with the quality of the evidence; however, under some circumstances, there may be valid reasons for making recommendations that are not closely aligned with the quality of the evidence (e.g., strong recommendation when the evidence quality is moderate, such as smoking cessation to reduce cardiovascular disease [CVD] risk or ordering an electrocardiogram [ECG] as part of the initial diagnostic work-up for a patient presenting with possible myocardial infarction [MI]). Those situations should be limited and the rationale explained clearly by the Work Group.</p>

<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*In some cases, other evidence, such as large all-or-none case series (e.g., jumping from airplanes or tall structures), can represent high- or moderate-quality evidence. In such cases, the rationale for the evidence rating exception should be explained by the Work Group and clearly justified.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>&amp;dagger;&quot;Well-designed, well-executed&quot; refers to studies that directly address the question; use adequate randomization, blinding, and allocation concealment; are adequately powered; use intention-to-treat analyses; and have high follow-up rates.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>&amp;Dagger;Limitations include concerns with the design and execution of a study that result in decreased confidence in the true estimate of the effect. Examples of such limitations include but are not limited to: inadequate randomization, lack of blinding of study participants or outcome assessors, inadequate power, outcomes of interest that are not prespecified for the primary outcomes, low follow-up rates, and findings based on subgroup analyses. Whether the limitations are considered minor or major is based on the number and severity of flaws in design or execution. Rules for determining whether the limitations are considered minor or major and how they will affect rating of the individual studies will be developed collaboratively with the methodology team.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>&amp;sect;Nonrandomized controlled studies refer to intervention studies where assignment to intervention and comparison groups is not random (e.g., quasi-experimental study design).</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>&amp;para;Observational studies include prospective and retrospective cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies.</p>

<p>The literature search was performed using an integrated suite of search engines that explored a central repository of citations and full-text journal articles. The central repository, search engines, search results, and Web-based modules for literature screening and data abstraction were integrated within a technology platform called the Virtual Collaborative Workspace (VCW). The VCW was custom-developed for the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) guidelines initiative.</p>
<p>The central repository consisted of 1.9 million citations and 71,000 full-text articles related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction. Citations were acquired from the PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL&amp;reg;, Cochrane, PsycINFO&amp;reg;, Wilson Science, and Biological Abstracts&amp;reg; databases. Literature searches were conducted using a collection of search engines including TeraText&amp;reg;, Content Analyst, Collexis, and Lucene. These engines were used for executing search strategies, and Lucene was used in correlating the search with screening results.</p>
<p>For every critical question (CQ), a literature search and screening were conducted according to the understanding of the question and the inclusion and exclusion (I/E) criteria that provided specific characteristics of studies relevant to the question. Criteria were framed in the PICOTS format specifying population, intervention, comparator, outcomes, timing, settings, and study design. The question and PICOTS components were translated into a search strategy involving Boolean and conceptual queries.</p>
<p>A Boolean query encodes both inclusion and exclusion rules. It grants access to the maximum quantity of citations, which are then analyzed by text analytics tools and ranked to produce a selection for literature screening that was conducted by two independent reviewers in the VCW's Web-based module. Boolean queries select citations by matching words in titles and abstracts, as well as Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and subheadings. The number of citations resulting from Boolean queries has ranged from a few hundred to several thousand depending on the question. The text analytics tools suite included:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>A natural language processing module for automated extraction of data elements in support of application of I/E criteria. Frequently extracted and utilized data elements were study size and intervention follow-up period. </li>
    <li>Content Analyst for automatically expanding vocabulary of queries, conceptual retrieval, and conceptual clustering. The conceptual query engine employed in Content Analyst leverages word frequency features and co-occurrence in similar contexts to index, select, and rank results. The indexing utilizes the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algebraic method. </li>
    <li>TeraText for ranking search results and a variety of fast operations on the inverted index. </li>
</ul>
<p>Search strategy development was intertwined with the results of literature screening, which provided feedback on search quality and context. Screened literature was categorized into two subsets: relevant or not relevant to the question. Next, results were analyzed to determine the characteristics of relevant versus not relevant citations. Additional keywords and MeSH terms were used to expand or contract the scope of the query as driven by characteristics of relevant citations. If the revised search strategy produced citations that did not undergo the screening process, then a new batch of citations was added for review. The search strategy refinement/literature review cycle was repeated until all citations covered by the most recent Boolean query had been screened.</p>
<p>Each search strategy was developed and implemented in the VCW. The search strategy was reviewed by the methodologist and Workgroup members, and was available for viewing and printing at any time by Workgroup members and staff collaborating on the systematic review. It was available for execution and supplying literature updates until the literature search and screening cut-off date.</p>
<p>Search strategies for a sample of questions were validated by an independent methodology team. This validation process involved the methodology team developing and executing a separate search strategy and screening a random sample of citations against I/E criteria; these results were compared to the search and screening results developed by the systematic review team. As an additional validation method, studies identified in systematic reviews and meta-analyses were cross-checked against a CQ's &quot;include&quot; list to ensure completeness of the search strategy.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Process for Literature Review and Application of I/E Criteria</span></strong></p>
<p>Using results from the search strategy, criteria were applied to screen literature for inclusion or exclusion in the evidence base for the CQ. I/E criteria address the parameters in the PICOTS framework and determine what types of studies are eligible and appropriate to answer the CQ. Additional criteria such as sample size restrictions were included by the Panel to fit the context of the CQ.</p>
<p><strong>Pilot Literature Screening Mode</strong></p>
<p>In the Pilot Literature Screening Mode, two reviewers independently screened the first 50 titles/abstracts in the search strategy results by applying I/E criteria. Reviewers voted to include or exclude the publication for full-text review. Reviewers compared their results to ensure that I/E criteria were applied consistently. Discrepancies in votes were discussed, and clarification on criteria was sought from the Panel where appropriate. For example, if criteria were not specific enough to be clearly applied to include or exclude a citation, guidance was sought to more explicitly word criteria.</p>
<p>During this phase, reviewers provided feedback to the Literature Search team about the relevance of search strategy results; this feedback was used to further refine and optimize the search.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1: Title and Abstract Screening Phase</strong></p>
<p>After the completion of the Pilot Mode phase, two reviewers independently screened search results at the title and abstract level by applying I/E criteria. Reviewers voted to include or exclude the publication for full-text review.</p>
<p>Titles and abstracts where one or both reviewers voted to include the publication advanced to Phase 2, Full-Text Screening. Titles and abstracts where both reviewers voted to exclude were excluded and not reviewed further; these citations were maintained in the VCW and marked as &quot;excluded at title/abstract phase.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Phase 2: Full-Text Screening Phase</strong></p>
<p>Titles and abstracts where at least one reviewer voted to include were reviewed at the full-text level in phase 2. In this phase, two reviewers independently applied I/E criteria to the full-text article and voted for &quot;include,&quot; &quot;exclude,&quot; or &quot;undecided.&quot; The reviewer had to specify the rationale for exclusion (i.e., population, intervention, etc.) in this phase.</p>
<p>Articles where both reviewers voted to include were moved to the &quot;include&quot; list. Articles where both reviewers voted to exclude were moved to the &quot;exclude&quot; list; these citations were maintained in the VCW and identified as &quot;excluded at the full article phase&quot; and the rationale for exclusion was noted. Any article with discrepant votes (i.e., one include and one undecided, one include and one exclude, etc.) advanced to phase 3.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 3: Resolution and Consultation Phase</strong></p>
<p>In this phase, reviewers discussed their vote for &quot;include,&quot; &quot;exclude,&quot; or &quot;undecided&quot; and cited the relevant criteria for their decision. The two reviewers attempted to achieve consensus through collaborative discussion. If a decision was not reached between the two reviewers, input was sought from the methodologist. If a decision was not reached after consultation with the methodologist, input was sought from the Panel; however, the methodologist had the final decision. The final disposition of the article (&quot;include&quot; or &quot;exclude&quot;) was recorded in the VCW along with comments from the adjudication process.</p>
<p>Similar to search strategies being posted and available for viewing on the VCW, all citations screened for a critical question were maintained in the VCW with their reviewer voting status and all collected comments.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>CQ 1 and CQ 2 Search Strategy Results</span></strong></p>
<p>The below listed databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials, and observational or epidemiologic studies with a time difference between interventions/exposures and outcomes (i.e., cohort studies, case-control studies) and systematic reviews and meta-analyses of these study designs to answer CQ1 and CQ2. Observational and epidemiologic studies or systematic reviews of such studies were eligible for hard health outcomes only.</p>

<p>The search produced 6,084 citations. This number of citations includes results from a supplemental search of PubMed for systematic reviews and meta-analyses focused on fatty acids, with publication dates between 1990 and 2009. A natural language processing (NLP) filter was used to identify studies with sample sizes less than 500, for studies reporting hard health outcomes and sample sizes less than 50, for biomarker assessment and risk factor studies. The NLP filter was executed against titles and abstracts, and 2,318 publications were automatically excluded because they were of studies with less than the required sample size. The titles and abstracts of the 3,768 remaining publications were screened against the inclusion/exclusion (I/E) criteria independently by two reviewers, which resulted in the retrieval of 1,237 full-text papers. These papers were independently screened by two reviewers and 1,209 of these publications were excluded on one or more of the I/E criteria. An additional 27 publications were excluded because they were rated as poor quality; 17 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 4 were cohort studies, and 6 were systematic reviews or meta-analyses. Twenty-eight articles were included in the Question 1 Evidence Base. Twenty-four were RCTs, 1 was a cohort study, and 3 were systematic reviews or meta-analyses.</p>
<p><strong>CQ2 Search Strategy Results</strong></p>
<p>The search produced 1,382 citations. This number of citations includes results from a supplemental search of PubMed that was extended to April 2012, and which was focused on sodium and hard health outcomes. An NLP filter was used to identify studies with sample sizes less than 500 for studies reporting hard health outcomes and for sample sizes less than 50 for biomarker assessment and risk factor studies. The NLP filter was executed against titles and abstracts. Six hundred and thirty-three publications were automatically excluded using the NLP filter because they were of studies with less than the required sample size. The titles and abstracts of the 749 remaining publications were screened against the I/E criteria independently by two reviewers, which resulted in the retrieval of 271 full-text papers. These papers were independently screened by two reviewers and 225 of these publications were excluded on one or more of the I/E criteria. An additional 5 publications were excluded because they were rated as poor quality; all 5 poor quality studies were RCTs. 46 articles were included in the Question 2 Evidence Base. Sixteen were RCTs, 25 were cohort studies, 1 was a case-control study, and 4 were systematic reviews or meta-analyses.</p>
<p><strong>CQ3 Search Strategy Results</strong></p>
<p>The search produced 843 systematic reviews and meta-analyses. An additional 24 citations published between January 2010 and May 2011 were retrieved from PubMed for review. The titles and abstracts of these 867 publications were screened against the I/E criteria independently by two reviewers which resulted in the retrieval of 184 full-text papers. These papers were independently screened by two reviewers, and 158 of these publications were excluded on one or more of the I/E criteria. The majority of full-text articles that were excluded were excluded because the outcomes did not meet those specified in the criteria. An additional 16 publications were excluded because they were rated as poor quality using the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Quality Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Twenty-six systematic reviews and meta-analyses were eligible for inclusion in the Question 3 Evidence Base. Twenty-five of the 26 included systematic reviews and meta-analyses were published between January 2001 and January 2010. One systematic review by Lin et al. that was published in December 2010 was retained in the body of evidence.</p></div>"/>

<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*In some cases, other evidence, such as large all-or-none case series (e.g., jumping from airplanes or tall structures), can represent high- or moderate-quality evidence. In such cases, the rationale for the evidence rating exception should be explained by the Work Group and clearly justified.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>&amp;dagger;&quot;Well-designed, well-executed&quot; refers to studies that directly address the question; use adequate randomization, blinding, and allocation concealment; are adequately powered; use intention-to-treat analyses; and have high follow-up rates.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>&amp;Dagger;Limitations include concerns with the design and execution of a study that result in decreased confidence in the true estimate of the effect. Examples of such limitations include but are not limited to: inadequate randomization, lack of blinding of study participants or outcome assessors, inadequate power, outcomes of interest that are not prespecified for the primary outcomes, low follow-up rates, and findings based on subgroup analyses. Whether the limitations are considered minor or major is based on the number and severity of flaws in design or execution. Rules for determining whether the limitations are considered minor or major and how they will affect rating of the individual studies will be developed collaboratively with the methodology team.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have collaborated with the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and stakeholder and professional organizations to develop clinical practice guidelines for assessment of cardiovascular risk, lifestyle modifications to reduce cardiovascular risk, management of blood cholesterol in adults, and management of overweight and obesity in adults.</p>
<p>In 2008, the NHLBI initiated these guidelines by sponsoring rigorous systematic evidence reviews for each topic by expert panels convened to develop critical questions (CQs), interpret the evidence, and craft recommendations. In response to the 2011 report from the Institute of Medicine on the development of trustworthy clinical guidelines, the NHLBI Advisory Council recommended that the NHLBI focus specifically on reviewing the highest-quality evidence and partner with other organizations to develop recommendations. Accordingly, in June 2013 the NHLBI initiated collaboration with the ACC and AHA to work with other organizations to complete and publish the 4 guidelines noted above and make them available to the widest possible constituency. Recognizing that the Expert Panels/Work Groups did not consider evidence beyond 2011 (except as specified in the methodology), the ACC, AHA, and collaborating societies plan to begin updating these guidelines starting in 2014.</p>
<p>The joint ACC/AHA Task Force on Practice Guidelines (Task Force) appointed a subcommittee to shepherd this transition, communicate the rationale and expectations to the writing panels and partnering organizations, and expeditiously publish the documents. The ACC/AHA and partner organizations recruited a limited number of expert reviewers for fiduciary examination of content, recognizing that each document had undergone extensive peer review by representatives of the NHLBI Advisory Council, key federal agencies, and scientific experts. Each writing panel responded to comments from these reviewers. Clarifications were incorporated where appropriate, but there were no substantive changes because the bulk of the content was undisputed.</p>
<p>Although the Task Force led the final development of these prevention guidelines, they differ from other ACC/AHA guidelines. First, as opposed to an extensive compendium of clinical information, these documents are significantly more limited in scope and focus on selected CQs on each topic, based on the highest-quality evidence available. Recommendations were derived from randomized trials, meta-analyses, and observational studies evaluated for quality and were not formulated when sufficient evidence was not available. Second, the text accompanying each recommendation is succinct, summarizing the evidence for each question. The Full Panel/Work Group Reports include more detailed information about the evidence statements (ESs) that serve as the basis for recommendations (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). Third, the format of the recommendations differs from other ACC/AHA guidelines. Each recommendation has been mapped from the NHLBI grading format to the ACC/AHA Classification of Recommendation/Level of Evidence (COR/LOE) construct (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field) and is expressed in both formats. Because of the inherent differences in grading systems and the clinical questions driving the recommendations, alignment between the NHLBI and ACC/AHA formats is in some cases imperfect. Explanations of these variations are noted in the recommendation tables, where applicable.</p>
<p><strong>CQ-Based Approach</strong></p>
<p>The Lifestyle Workgroup developed an initial set of questions based on their expertise and a brief literature review to identify topics of the greatest relevance and impact for the target audience of the guideline, primary care providers. Due to time and resource limitations, the Workgroup prioritized the final three critical questions below.</p>
<p>The body of the report is organized by CQ. For each CQ:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The rationale for its selection is provided, and methods are described. </li>
    <li>The ESs are presented, which include a rating for quality, a rationale that supports each item of evidence, and a statement. A detailed description of methods is provided in the <em>NHLBI Lifestyle Systematic Evidence Review Report</em> (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). The <em>Full Work Group Report</em> supplement presents documentation for search strategies and results from the search of the published literature (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). </li>
    <li>Recommendations include recommendation strength, accompanied by a summary of how the recommendation derives from the evidence and a discussion of issues considered by the Work Group in formulating the recommendation. The ACC/AHA COR/LOE ratings have also been added. </li>
</ul>
<p>The ESs and recommendations are presented by CQ and grouped by topic:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>CQ1 presents evidence on dietary patterns and macronutrients and their effect on blood pressure (BP) and lipids. The dietary recommendations for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering are described at the end of CQ1. </li>
    <li>CQ2 presents the evidence on the effect of dietary sodium and potassium intake on BP and cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. The dietary recommendations for BP lowering are located at the end of CQ2. </li>
    <li>Finally, CQ3 presents evidence on the effect of physical activity on lipids an activity recommendations for BP and lipid lowering. The physical activity recommendations for BP and lipid lowering are located at the end of CQ3. </li>
</ul>
<p>It should be recognized that formulating recommendations derived from evidence reviews in response to CQs has some advantages as well as limitations. Because of its desire to adhere to the highest quality of evidence, the Work Group was restricted to using evidence that met inclusion/exclusion and quality criteria established by the Work Group in partnership with the methodologists. When the phrase &quot;there is insufficient evidence&quot; is used, the reader must distinguish between &quot;insufficient&quot; evidence where no studies meeting inclusion/exclusion and quality criteria were found to answer a CQ and &quot;insufficient&quot; evidence where RCTs or observational studies were conducted but the available data do not provide sufficient information to formulate a recommendation. This perspective is important because clinicians could see fewer recommendations derived from expert opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Organization of Work Group</strong></p>
<p>The Work Group was composed of 12 members and 4 ex-officio members, including physicians and experts in BP, blood cholesterol, obesity, and lifestyle management. The authors came from the primary care, nursing, pharmacology, nutrition, exercise, behavioral science, and epidemiology disciplines and also included senior scientific staff from NHLBI and the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p><strong>Development and Prioritization of Questions</strong></p>
<p>After Panels were convened, members were invited to submit topic areas or questions for systematic review. Members were asked to identify topics of the greatest relevance and impact for the target audience of the guideline, primary care providers.</p>
<p>Proposed questions and topic areas were collected from Panel members over a period of several months. The number of critical questions was scoped, and questions were prioritized based on resource constraints. After group discussion, Panel members ranked priority critical questions through a combination of collaborative dialogue and voting. The rationale for each priority critical question is in the main body of the report.</p>
<p>With support from the methodologist and systematic review team, priority critical questions were formulated. Inclusion/exclusion (I/E) criteria were defined and formatted using the PICOTS framework. PICOTS is a framework for developing a structured research question. It includes the following components in the statement of the critical question or in the question's I/E criteria: population, intervention/exposure, comparator, outcome, timing, setting.</p>
<p>I/E criteria define the parameters for the selection of literature for a particular critical question. I/E criteria were developed with input from the methodologist and systematic review team to ensure that criteria were clear and precise and could be applied consistently across literature identified in the search.</p>
<p>The final critical questions and criteria were submitted to the Literature Search team for search strategy development:</p>
<p>CQ1. Among adults, what is the effect of dietary patterns and/or macronutrient composition on CVD risk factors, when compared with no treatment or with other types of interventions?</p>
<p>CQ2. Among adults, what is the effect of dietary intake of sodium and potassium on CVD risk factors and outcomes, when compared with no treatment or with other types of interventions?</p>
<p>CQ3. Among adults, what is the effect of physical activity on blood pressure and lipids when compared with no treatment or with other types of interventions?</p>
<p><strong>Process for the Development of Evidence Statements, Recommendations, and Panel Voting</strong></p>
<p>Using the summary tables (and evidence tables as needed), evidence statements were collaboratively written by Work group or Panel members with input from methodology staff and oversight of the process by NHLBI staff. Evidence statements aimed to summarize key messages from the evidence that could be provided to primary care physicians and other stakeholders. In some cases, the evidence was too limited or inconclusive, so no evidence statement was developed, or a statement of insufficient evidence was made.</p>
<p>Methodology staff provided Panels with overarching guidance on how to grade the level of evidence (high, moderate, or low), and the Panels used this guidance to grade each evidence statement.</p>
<p>Panel members who had relationships with industry (RWI) or other possible conflicts of interest (COI) were allowed to participate in discussions leading up to voting as long as they declared their relationships, but they recused themselves from voting on any issue relating to their RWI or potential COI. Voting occurred by a Panel Chair asking each member to signify his or her vote. The NHLBI project staff and contractors did not vote.</p>
<p>Once evidence statements were finalized, attention turned to developing recommendations. Recommendations were developed using a similar process to evidence statements. For approval of a recommendation rated E (expert opinion), at least 75 percent of the Workgroup/Panel members had to vote &quot;yes.&quot; For both evidence statements and recommendations, voting could be open so that differing viewpoints could be identified easily and facilitate further discussion and revisions to address areas of disagreement (e.g., by wordsmithing or dividing an evidence statement into more than one statement). Voting could be by confidential ballot if the group chose.</p>
<p>For both evidence statements and recommendations, a record of the vote count (for, against, or recusal) was made without attribution. The ideal was 100 percent consensus, but a two-thirds majority was considered acceptable.</p></div>"/>

<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*In most cases, the strength of the recommendation should be closely aligned with the quality of the evidence; however, under some circumstances, there may be valid reasons for making recommendations that are not closely aligned with the quality of the evidence (e.g., strong recommendation when the evidence quality is moderate, such as smoking cessation to reduce cardiovascular disease [CVD] risk or ordering an electrocardiogram [ECG] as part of the initial diagnostic work-up for a patient presenting with possible myocardial infarction [MI]). Those situations should be limited and the rationale explained clearly by the Work Group.</p>
