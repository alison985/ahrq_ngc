	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Note from the British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) and the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The BCSH has released an amendment to the original guideline document that discusses anti-D prophylaxis in overweight women and provides a clarification of the recommendations regarding anti-D prophylaxis following intrauterine death (IUD). See the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; for further information.</p>
<p>Definitions for the quality of the evidence (<strong>A&amp;ndash;C</strong>) and strength of recommendations (Strong [<strong>Grade 1</strong>], Weak [<strong>Grade 2</strong>]) are given at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong>Potentially Sensitising Events Requiring Anti-D Immunoglobulin (Anti-D Ig) Prophylaxis</strong></p>
<p>Following potentially sensitising events, anti-D Ig should be administered as soon as possible and always within 72 h of the event. If, exceptionally, this deadline has not been met some protection may be offered if anti-D Ig is given up to 10 days after the sensitising event (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Potentially Sensitising Events in Pregnancies of Less Than 12 Weeks of Gestation</strong></p>
<p>In pregnancies &amp;lt;12 weeks gestation, anti-D Ig prophylaxis (minimum dose 250 IU) is only indicated following an ectopic pregnancy, molar pregnancy, therapeutic termination of pregnancy and in some cases of uterine bleeding where this is repeated, heavy or associated with abdominal pain. A test for fetomaternal haemorrhage (FMH) is not required (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Potentially Sensitising Events in Pregnancies of 12 Weeks to Less Than 20 Weeks Gestation</strong></p>
<p>For potentially sensitising events between 12 and 20 weeks gestation a minimum dose of 250 IU should be administered within 72 h of the event. A test for FMH is not required (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Potentially Sensitising Events in Pregnancies of 20 Weeks of Gestation to Term</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>For potentially sensitising events after 20 weeks gestation a minimum anti-D Ig dose of 500 IU should be administered within 72 h of the event (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Appropriate tests for FMH should be carried out for all D negative, previously non-sensitised, pregnant women who have had a potentially sensitising event after 20 weeks of gestation, and additional dose(s) of anti-D Ig should be administered as necessary (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Routine Antenatal Anti-D Prophylaxis (RAADP)</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>All D negative pregnant women who have not been previously sensitised should be offered routine RAADP either with a single dose regimen given around 28 weeks, or two dose regimen given at around 28 and 34 weeks (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>It is important that the 28-week sample for blood group and antibody screen is taken prior to the first routine prophylactic anti-D Ig injection being given. This forms the second screen required in pregnancy as stated in the British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) Guidelines for Blood Grouping and Red Cell Antibody Testing during pregnancy (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The RAADP scheme should be regarded as supplementary to any anti-D Ig administered for sensitising episodes listed in Table 1 in the original guideline document (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prophylaxis Following Birth of a D Positive Child or Intrauterine Death</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Following birth, ABO and rhesus (Rh) D typing should be performed on cord blood sample and if the baby is confirmed to be D positive, all D negative, previously non-sensitised, women should receive at least 500 IU of anti-D Ig within 72 h following delivery. Maternal samples should be tested for FMH and additional dose(s) given as guided by FMH tests (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>If there is an intrauterine death (IUD) and hence no sample can be obtained from the baby, prophylactic anti-D Ig should be administered to D negative, previously non-sensitised women. A minimum of 500 IU of anti-D Ig should be administered within 72 h following the diagnosis of IUD. Maternal samples should be tested for FMH and additional dose(s) given as guided by FMH tests. It should be noted that the diagnosis of IUD is the sensitising event rather than delivery and hence anti-D Ig should be administered within 72 h of diagnosis (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>If cord blood sample cannot be obtained or if cord blood group cannot be established for any reason, at least 500 IU anti-D Ig should be administered to D negative, previously non-sensitised women (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Where intra-operative cell salvage (ICS) is used during Caesarean section in D negative, previously non-sensitised women, and where cord blood group is confirmed as D positive (or unknown), a minimum dose of 1500 IU anti-D Ig should be administered following the re-infusion of salvaged red cells, and a maternal sample should be taken for estimation of FMH 30 to 45 min after reinfusion in case more anti-D Ig is indicated. It is important that clinicians inform the transfusion laboratory if ICS has been used to ensure that correct dose of anti-D Ig is issued (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Principles, Safety, Availability, Dosage and Administration of Anti-D Ig</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Adequate records of issue and administration should be maintained to allow full traceability of anti-D immunoglobulin (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Where anti-D is detected in a sample from a pregnant woman, further history should be obtained and investigations undertaken to establish whether this is immune or passive. If no clear conclusion can be reached as to the origin of anti-D, then prophylaxis should continue to be administered in accordance with guidelines for D negative women who have not formed immune anti-D (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Definitions</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong>Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The quality of evidence is graded as high (A), moderate (B) or low (C). To put this in context it is useful to consider the uncertainty of knowledge and whether further research could change what is&amp;nbsp;known or is certain.</p>
<p><strong>(A) High</strong>: Further research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect. Current evidence derived from randomised clinical trials without important limitations.</p>
<p><strong>(B) Moderate</strong>: Further research may well have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Current evidence derived from randomised clinical trials with important limitations (e.g., inconsistent results, imprecision &amp;ndash; wide confidence intervals or methodological flaws &amp;ndash; e.g., lack of blinding, large losses to follow up, failure to adhere to intention to treat analysis), or very strong evidence from observational studies or case series (e.g., large or very large and consistent estimates of the magnitude of a treatment effect or demonstration of a dose&amp;ndash;response gradient).</p>
<p><strong>(C) Low</strong>: Further research is likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Current evidence from observational studies, case series or just opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Strong (Grade 1)</strong>: Strong recommendations (Grade 1) are made when there is confidence that the benefits do or do not outweigh harm and burden. Grade 1 recommendations can be applied uniformly to most patients. Regard as &quot;recommend&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Weak (Grade 2)</strong>: Where the magnitude of benefit or not is less certain a weaker Grade 2 recommendation is made. Grade 2 recommendations require judicious application to individual patients. Regard as &quot;suggest&quot;.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The manufacturing process for anti-D immunoglobulin (anti-D Ig) preparations includes viral inactivation steps in order to further reduce the risk of viral transmission. The theoretical risk of transmission of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) remains unquantifiable, though is likely to be extremely small. </li>
    <li>Product safety data submitted by manufacturers to inform National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence technical appraisal guidance 156 (NICE, 2002, 2008) indicates a very low rate of reporting a probable or possible adverse event, estimated to be less than one event per 80,000 doses of anti-D Ig. The majority of reported adverse events were not considered serious. There is no evidence to suggest that anti-D Ig administered to women during pregnancy is harmful to the fetus. </li>
    <li>Allergic reactions are very rare but severe hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis may occur. Anti-D preparations may contain trace amounts of immunoglobulin A (IgA) (less than 5 &amp;mu;gmL<sup>&amp;minus;1</sup>) and hence patients with known antibodies to IgA have a greater risk of developing potentially severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions. If symptoms of allergic or early signs of hypersensitivity reactions (including generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis) develop, administration of anti-D must be discontinued immediately and appropriate treatment instituted. Manufacturer's prescribing information for Rhophylac&amp;reg; recommends that medication such as adrenaline should be available for immediate treatment of acute severe hypersensitivity reactions. </li>
    <li>When more than one unit of D positive blood has been inadvertently transfused to D negative women, a red cell exchange transfusion should be considered to reduce the load of D positive red cells in the circulation and the dose of anti-D Ig required to prevent immunisation. In this situation advice should be sought from a specialist in transfusion medicine, and the patient should be counselled regarding the implications of both non-intervention (for future pregnancies) and of treatment, including any hazards from receiving donated blood, the exchange procedure itself and of larger doses of anti-D Ig, including intravenous (IV) anti-D Ig. </li>
    <li>It should be noted that due to the nature of the manufacturing process, D-GAM&amp;reg; preparations are suitable for intramuscular (IM) USE ONLY and therefore <em>must not</em> be administered IV because of the risk of severe hypersensitivity reactions due to the presence of trace amounts of IgA and other plasma proteins. </li>
    <li>When large or multiple doses of anti-D Ig are necessary, consideration should be given to limiting batch exposure whenever possible, for example, reserving the same anti-D Ig batch for routine antenatal anti-D prophylaxis (RAADP) and the postnatal dose, but this should not in any way delay the timely provision of anti-D Ig. </li>
    <li>The deltoid muscle is an appropriate and safe site for IM administration of anti-D Ig. If the gluteal region is used, particular care should be taken to ensure that the injection is given into muscle, as absorption may be delayed if it only reaches the subcutaneous tissues. In women with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count&amp;le;30&amp;times;109/L) or a history of a bleeding disorder such as severe Von Willebrand disease, anti-D Ig should be administered IV or subcutaneously depending on whether a preparation suitable for IV use is available. Women with significant bleeding disorders such as Von Willebrand disease should be managed jointly with a haemophilia centre. </li>
    <li>The risk of a false negative result (i.e., missing an D positive fetal blood group) in fetal blood group genotyping using cell free fetal deoxyribonucleic acid (cffDNA) from maternal blood samples taken at 16 to 20 week gestation is small and currently estimated to be around 0.08 to 0.16% according to one study. </li>
