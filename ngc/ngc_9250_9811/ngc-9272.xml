<p><strong>Treatment with Iron Agents</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>When prescribing iron therapy, balance the potential benefits of avoiding or minimizing blood transfusions, ESA therapy, and anemia-related symptoms against the risks of harm in individual patients (e.g., anaphylactoid and other acute reactions, unknown long-term risks). (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>For adult CKD patients with anemia not on iron or ESA therapy, the Work Group suggests a trial of intravenous (IV) iron (or in CKD ND patients alternatively a 1&amp;ndash;3 month trial of oral iron therapy) if (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>):
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>An increase in Hb concentration without starting ESA treatment is desired* and </li>
        <li>TSAT is &amp;le;30% and ferritin is &amp;le;500 ng/ml (&amp;le;500 &amp;micro;g/l) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>For adult CKD patients on ESA therapy who are not receiving iron supplementation, the Work Group suggests a trial of IV iron (or in CKD ND patients alternatively a 1&amp;ndash;3 month trial of oral iron therapy) if (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>):
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>An increase in Hb concentration** or a decrease in ESA dose is desired*** and </li>
        <li>TSAT is &amp;le;30% and ferritin is &amp;le;500 ng/ml (&amp;le;500 &amp;micro;g/l) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>For CKD ND patients who require iron supplementation, select the route of iron administration based on the severity of iron deficiency, availability of venous access, response to prior oral iron therapy, side effects with prior oral or IV iron therapy, patient compliance, and cost. (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>Guide subsequent iron administration in CKD patients based on Hb responses to recent iron therapy, as well as ongoing blood losses, iron status tests (TSAT and ferritin), Hb concentration, ESA responsiveness and ESA dose in ESA treated patients, trends in each parameter, and the patient&amp;rsquo;s clinical status. (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>For all pediatric CKD patients with anemia not on iron or ESA therapy, the Work Group recommends oral iron (or IV iron in CKD HD patients) administration when TSAT is &amp;le;20% and ferritin is &amp;le;100 ng/ml (&amp;le;100 &amp;micro;g/l). (<em><strong>1D</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>For all pediatric CKD patients on ESA therapy who are not receiving iron supplementation, the Work Group recommends oral iron (or IV iron in CKD HD patients) administration to maintain TSAT &amp;gt;20% and ferritin &amp;gt;100 ng/ml (&amp;gt;100 &amp;micro;g/l). (<em><strong>1D</strong></em>) </li>

**Consistent with recommendations below under 'ESA Initiation.'<br />
***Based on patient symptoms and overall clinical goals including avoidance of transfusion and improvement in anemia-related symptoms, and after exclusion of active infection and other causes of ESA hyporesponsiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Iron Status Evaluation</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Evaluate iron status (TSAT and ferritin) at least every 3 months during ESA therapy, including the decision to start or continue iron therapy. (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>Test iron status (TSAT and ferritin) more frequently when initiating or increasing ESA dose, when there is blood loss, when monitoring response after a course of IV iron, and in other circumstances where iron stores may become depleted. (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cautions Regarding Iron Therapy</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>When the initial dose of IV iron dextran is administered, the Work Group recommends (<em><strong>1B</strong></em>) and when the initial dose of IV nondextran iron is administered, the Work Group suggests (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>) that patients be monitored for 60 minutes after the infusion, and that resuscitative facilities (including medications) and personnel trained to evaluate and treat serious adverse reactions be available. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Iron During Infection</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Avoid administering IV iron to patients with active systemic infections. (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Use of ESAs and Other Agents to Treat Anemia in CKD</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>ESA Initiation</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Address all correctable causes of anemia (including iron deficiency and inflammatory states) prior to initiation of ESA therapy. (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>In initiating and maintaining ESA therapy, the Work Group recommends balancing the potential benefits of reducing blood transfusions and anemia-related symptoms against the risks of harm in individual patients (e.g., stroke, vascular access loss, hypertension). (<em><strong>1B</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends using ESA therapy with great caution, if at all, in CKD patients with active malignancy&amp;mdash;in particular when cure is the anticipated outcome&amp;mdash;(<em><strong>1B</strong></em>), a history of stroke (<em><strong>1B</strong></em>), or a history of malignancy. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>For adult CKD ND patients with Hb concentration &amp;ge;10.0 g/dl (&amp;ge;100 g/l), the Work Group suggests that ESA therapy not be initiated. (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>For adult CKD ND patients with Hb concentration &amp;lt;10.0 g/dl (&amp;lt;100 g/l), the Work Group suggests that the decision whether to initiate ESA therapy be individualized based on the rate of fall of Hb concentration, prior response to iron therapy, the risk of needing a transfusion, the risks related to ESA therapy and the presence of symptoms attributable to anemia. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>For adult CKD 5D patients, the Work Group suggests that ESA therapy be used to avoid having the Hb concentration fall below 9.0 g/dl (90 g/l) by starting ESA therapy when the hemoglobin is between 9.0&amp;ndash;10.0 g/dl (90&amp;ndash;100 g/l). (<em><strong>2B</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>Individualization of therapy is reasonable as some patients may have improvements in quality of life at higher Hb concentration and ESA therapy may be started above 10.0 g/dl (100 g/l). (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>For all pediatric CKD patients, the Work Group suggests that the selection of Hb concentration at which ESA therapy is initiated in the individual patient includes consideration of potential benefits (e.g., improvement in quality of life, school attendance/performance, and avoidance of transfusion) and potential harms. (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ESA Maintenance Therapy</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>In general, the Work Group suggests that ESAs not be used to maintain Hb concentration above 11.5 g/dl (115 g/l) in adult patients with CKD. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>Individualization of therapy will be necessary as some patients may have improvements in quality of life at Hb concentration above 11.5 g/dl (115 g/l) and will be prepared to accept the risks. (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>In all adult patients, the Work Group recommends that ESAs not be used to intentionally increase the Hb concentration above 13 g/dl (130 g/l). (<em><strong>1A</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>In all pediatric CKD patients receiving ESA therapy, the Work Group suggests that the selected Hb concentration be in the range of 11.0 to 12.0 g/dl (110 to 120 g/l). (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>) </li>

<p>The Work Group sought to build on the evidence base and topics addressed in the previous Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for anemia in chronic kidney disease in 2006 as well as the KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for anemia in chronic kidney disease 2007 update of hemoglobin target. Modules were created for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), kidney disease, anemia, and erythropoietin, transfusion, iron deficiency, and adjuvant search terms. The search terms were then limited to years 2006&amp;ndash;2010 for studies related to anemia interventions. For transfusion the literature search was conducted from 1989&amp;ndash;2010. A separate search was run for observational studies on iron overload and hemoglobin status as predictors for clinical outcomes (see Appendix 1 in the supplemental appendices; see the 'Availability of Companion Documents' field).</p>
<p>The searches were run in MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The initial search for RCTs was conducted in April 2010 and subsequently updated in October of 2010. The search for observational studies was later conducted in September 2010. The search yield was also supplemented by articles provided by Work Group members through March 2012. MEDLINE search results were screened by members of the ERT for relevance using pre-defined eligibility criteria.</p>
<p>The total yield from the search was 4,334 abstracts for RCTs and 3,717 abstracts for observational studies. Fifty-six abstracts and 53 full texts from RCTs were accepted and 97 abstracts and 21 full texts from observational studies were accepted. Journal articles reporting original data, meta-analyses or systematic reviews were selected for evidence review. Editorials, letters, abstracts, unpublished reports and articles published in non-peer reviewed journals were not included. The Work Group also decided to exclude publications from journal supplements because of potential differences in the process of how they get solicited, selected, reviewed and edited compared to peer-reviewed publications.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations of Approach</strong></p>
<p>While the literature searches were intended to be comprehensive, they were not exhaustive. MEDLINE was the only database searched. Hand searches of journals were not performed, and review articles and textbook chapters were not systematically searched. However, important studies known to domain experts that were missed by the electronic literature searches were added to retrieved articles and reviewed by the Work Group.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Data Extraction</strong></p>
<p>Fifty-three full text articles from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were extracted by the Evidence Review Team (ERT). The ERT, in consultation with the Work Group, designed forms to capture data on design, methodology, sample characteristics, interventions, comparators, outcomes, results and limitations of individual studies. Methodology and outcomes were also systematically graded (see the section on grading below) and recorded during the data extraction process.</p>
<p><strong>Summary Tables</strong></p>
<p>Summary tables were developed for each comparison of interest. Studies included in the evidence base for the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) clinical practice guidelines on Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and update of hemoglobin target were also incorporated if they fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the current guideline.</p>
<p>Summary tables contain outcomes of interest, relevant population characteristics, description of intervention and comparator, results, and quality grading for each outcome. Categorical and continuous outcomes were summarized separately. Work Group members proofed all summary table data and quality assessments. Summary tables are available (see the 'Availability of Companion Documents' field).</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Profiles</strong></p>
<p>Evidence profiles were constructed to assess and record quality grading and description of effect for each outcome across studies, and quality of overall evidence and description of net benefits or harms of intervention or comparator across all outcomes. These profiles aim to make the evidence synthesis process transparent. Decisions in the evidence profiles were based on data from the primary studies listed in corresponding summary tables, and on judgments of the ERT and the Work Group. When the body of evidence for a particular comparison of interest consisted of only one study, the summary table provided the final level of synthesis and evidence profile was not generated. Each evidence profile was initially constructed by the ERT and then reviewed, edited and approved by the Work Group.</p>
<p><strong>Rating the Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>A structured approach, based on Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) and facilitated by the use of evidence profiles was used in order to grade the quality of the overall evidence. For each topic, the discussion on grading of the quality of the evidence was led by the ERT, and the discussion regarding the strength of the recommendations was led by the Work Group Chairs. The 'quality of a body of evidence' refers to the extent to which our confidence in an estimate of effect is sufficient to support a particular recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Grading the Quality of Evidence for Each Outcome</strong></p>
<p>Following GRADE, the quality of a body of evidence pertaining to a particular outcome of interest was initially categorized based on study design. For questions of interventions, the initial quality grade was 'High' when the body of evidence consisted of randomized controlled trials; 'Low', if it consisted of observational studies; or 'Very Low', if it consisted of studies of other study designs. For questions of interventions, the Work Group decided to use only randomized controlled trials. The grade for the quality of evidence for each intervention/outcome pair was then lowered if there were serious limitations to the methodological quality of the aggregate of studies, if there were important inconsistencies in the results across studies, if there was uncertainty about the directness of evidence including limited applicability of the findings to the population of interest, if the data were imprecise (a low event rate [0 or 1 event] in either arm or confidence interval spanning a range &amp;lt;0.5 to &amp;gt;2.0) or sparse (only 1 study or total N &amp;lt;100), or if there was thought to be a high likelihood of bias. The final grade for the quality of the evidence for an intervention/outcome pair could be one of the following four grades: 'High', 'Moderate', 'Low' or 'Very Low' (see the 'Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence' field).</p>
<p><strong>Grading the Overall Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The quality of the overall body of evidence was then determined based on the quality grades for all outcomes of interest, taking into account explicit judgments about the relative importance of each outcome. The resulting four final categories for the quality of overall evidence were: 'A', 'B', 'C' or 'D' (see the 'Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence' field).</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Overview Process</strong></p>
<p>The Work Group, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Co-Chairs, Evidence Review Team (ERT), and KDIGO support staff met for two 2-day meetings for training in the guideline development process, topic discussion, and consensus development.</p>
<p><strong>Commissioning of Work Group and Evidence Review Team</strong></p>
<p>KDIGO Co-Chairs appointed the Work Group Co-chairs. Work Group Co-Chairs then assembled the Work Group consisting of domain experts, including individuals with expertise in internal medicine, adult and pediatric nephrology, cardiology, hematology, oncology, hypertension, pathology, pharmacology, epidemiology and endocrinology. Tufts Center for Kidney Disease Guideline Development and Implementation at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, USA was contracted to conduct systematic evidence review and provide expertise in guideline development methodology. The ERT consisted of physician-methodologists with expertise in nephrology, a project coordinator and manager, and a research assistant. The ERT instructed and advised Work Group members in all steps of literature review, critical literature appraisal, and guideline development. The Work Group and the ERT collaborated closely throughout the project.</p>
<p><strong>Defining Scope and Topics</strong></p>
<p>Work Group Co-Chairs first defined the overall scope and goals of the guideline. Work Group Co-Chairs then drafted a preliminary list of topics and key clinical questions. In light of new evidence, it was decided that an update of the topics presented in the 2006 and 2007 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines would be the best approach. The Work Group and ERT further developed and refined each topic, specified screening criteria, literature search strategies, and data extraction forms (see Table 8 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>Establishing the Process for Guideline Development</strong></p>
<p>The ERT performed literature searches, organized abstract and article screening. The ERT also coordinated the methodological and analytic process of the report, defined and standardized the methodology of performing literature searches, data extraction, and summarizing the evidence. Throughout the project, the ERT offered suggestions for guideline development, led discussions on systematic review, literature searches, data extraction, assessment of quality and applicability of articles, evidence synthesis, grading of evidence and guideline recommendations, and consensus development. The Work Group took the primary role of writing the guidelines and rationale statements and retained final responsibility for the content of the guideline statements and the accompanying narrative.</p>
<p>The Work Group Co-Chairs prepared the first draft of the scope of work document as a series of topics to be considered by Work Group members. The scope of work document was based primarily on the existing KDOQI guidelines on anemia. At their first two-day meeting, Work Group members revised the initial working document to include all topics of interest to the Work Group. The inclusive, combined set of questions formed the basis for the deliberation and discussion that followed. The Work Group strove to ensure that all topics deemed clinically relevant and worthy of review were identified and addressed.</p>
<p><strong>Formulating Questions of Interest</strong></p>
<p>Questions of interest were formulated according to the PICODD (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, study Design and Duration of follow up) criteria. Details of the PICODD criteria are presented in Table 8 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Ranking of Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>The Work Group ranked outcomes of interest based on their importance for informing clinical decision making (see Table 9 in the original guideline). Mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) outcomes were graded as 'critical,' transfusion and quality of life (QoL) outcomes were graded as 'high,' and all other outcomes were graded as 'moderate.'</p>
<p><strong>Grading the Strength of the Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The strength of a recommendation is graded as Level 1 or Level 2. The 'Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations' field shows the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) nomenclature for grading the strength of a recommendation and the implications of each level for patients, clinicians and policy makers. Recommendations can be for or against doing something. Table 16 in the original guideline document shows that the strength of a recommendation is determined not just by the quality of the evidence, but also by other, often complex judgments regarding the size of the net medical benefit, values and preferences, and costs. Formal decision analyses including cost analysis were not conducted.</p>
<p><strong>Ungraded Statements</strong></p>
<p>This category was designed to allow the Work Group to issue general advice. Typically an ungraded statement meets the following criteria: it provides guidance based on common sense; it provides reminders of the obvious; it is not sufficiently specific to allow application of evidence to the issue and therefore it is not based on systematic evidence review. Common examples include recommendations about frequency of testing, referral to specialists, and routine medical care. The Work Group strove to minimize the use of ungraded recommendations.</p>
<p>This grading scheme with two levels for the strength of a recommendation together with four levels of grading the quality of the evidence, and the option of an ungraded statement for general guidance was adopted by the KDIGO Board in December 2008. The Work Group took the primary role of writing the recommendations and rationale statements and retained final responsibility for the content of the guideline statements and the accompanying narrative. The ERT reviewed draft recommendations and grades for consistency with the conclusions of the evidence review.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Oral iron is inexpensive, readily available, and does not require intravenous (IV) access, a particular concern in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients not on hemodialysis. It is also not associated with severe adverse effects but gastrointestinal side effects are common and may limit adherence. This, along with variable gastrointestinal tract absorption, limits the efficacy of oral iron. IV iron avoids concerns about medication adherence and efficacy in treating iron deficiency, but requires IV access and has been associated with infrequent but severe adverse reactions. Decisions about the preferred route of iron supplementation should take into consideration severity of anemia and iron deficiency, the response, tolerance and adherence to prior oral iron administration, costs, and ease of obtaining venous access balanced against the desire to preserve venous access. </li>
    <li>Any form of IV iron may be associated with potentially severe acute reactions. The symptoms of most concern are hypotension and dyspnea, which in the worst cases may be catastrophic with features of anaphylaxis. The cause of reactions has not been fully characterized, but may involve immune mechanisms and/or release of free, reactive iron into the circulation with induction of oxidative stress. The mechanisms of acute reactions may differ for different iron preparations. Certain iron dextrans in particular have been associated with reactions characteristic of anaphylaxis. The rate of such reactions is estimated to occur in 0.6%&amp;ndash;0.7% of patients treated. The serious adverse effect event rate may be lower with low molecular weight iron dextran compared to high molecular weight iron dextran. </li>
    <li>Risks associated with blood transfusion include transfusion errors, volume overload, hyperkalemia, citrate toxicity (leading to metabolic alkalosis and hypocalcemia), hypothermia, coagulopathy, immunologically mediated transfusion reactions, including transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), and iron overload, all of which are uncommon (see Table 5 in the original guideline document). Transmission of infections, although rare, is a major concern and this risk varies between countries (see Table 6 in the original guideline document). </li>
    <li>There may be toxicity from high doses of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA), as suggested, though not proven, by recent post-hoc analyses of major ESA randomized controlled trials, especially in conjunction with the achievement of high hemoglobin levels. Therefore, in general ESA dose escalation should be avoided. The Work Group suggestions for initial and acquired hyporesponsiveness imply that maximal doses should be no greater than four times initial weight-based appropriate doses. </li>
