            <p><strong>Diagnostic Tests</strong></p>
            <p>In chronic low back pain, X-rays of the lumbar spine are very poor indicators of serious pathology. Hence, in the absence of clinical red flags spinal x-rays are not encouraged. More specific and appropriate diagnostic imaging should be performed on the basis of the pathology being sought (e.g., dual energy X-ray absorptiometry [DEXA] scan for bone density, bone scan for tumors and inflammatory diseases). However, lumbar spine X-rays may be required for correlation prior to more sophisticated diagnostic imaging, for example prior to a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. In this case, the views should be limited to standing anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral in order to achieve better assessment of stability and stenosis. Oblique views are not generally recommended. Computed tomography (CT) scans are best limited to suspected fractures or contraindication to MRI.</p>
            <p>In the absence of red flags, radiculopathy, or neurogenic claudication, MRI scanning is generally of limited value.</p>
            <p><em>Oblique view X-rays are not recommended; they add only minimal information in a small percentage of cases, and more than double the patient's exposure to radiation</em>.</p>

            <p><strong>Physical Exercise</strong></p>
            <p>Patients should be encouraged to initiate gentle exercise and gradually increase their exercise level within their pain tolerance.</p>
            <p>Sophisticated equipment is not necessary. Low cost alternatives include unsupervised walking and group exercise programs such as those offered though chronic disease management programs. The peer support of group exercise is likely to result in better outcomes, giving patients improved confidence and empowering them to manage with less medical intervention.</p>
            <p>When exercise exacerbates the patient's pain, the exercise program should be assessed by a qualified physical therapist or exercise specialist.</p>
            <p>If exercise persistently exacerbates their pain, patients should be further assessed by a physician to determine if further investigation, medication, treatment, or consultation is required.</p>
            <p><em>Some studies reported mild negative reactions to the exercise programs, such as increased low back pain and muscle soreness in some patients</em>.</p>

            <p>Where available, refer to a structured community-based self-management group program for patients who are interested in learning pain coping skills.

These programs use goal setting and 'homework assignments' to encourage participants' self confidence in their ability to successfully manage their pain and increase their day-to-day functioning. Most community-based programs also include exercise and activity programming which are also recommended.</p>

            <p><strong>Opioids</strong></p>
            <p>Long-term use of weak opioids, like codeine, should only follow an unsuccessful trial of non-opioid analgesics. In severe chronic pain, opioids are worth careful consideration. Long-acting opioids can establish a steady state blood and tissue level that may minimize the patient's experience of increased pain from medication withdrawal experienced with short acting opioids.</p>
            <p>Careful attention to incremental changes in pain intensity, function, and side effects is required to achieve optimal benefit. Because little is known about the long-term effects of opioid therapy, it should be monitored carefully.</p>
            <p><em>Opioid side-effects (including headache, nausea, somnolence, constipation, dry mouth, and dizziness) should be high in the differential diagnosis of new complaints</em>.</p>
            <p>A history of addiction is a relative contraindication. Consultation with an addictions specialist may be helpful in these cases.</p>
            <p>Consult the National Opioid Use Guideline Group guideline Canadian Guideline for Safe and Effective Use of Opioids for Chronic Non-Cancer Pain, endorsed by the College of Physicians &amp;amp; Surgeons of Alberta (CPSA) (see also Medication Table in Appendix B in the original guideline document).</p>

            <p>The following injection therapies may be beneficial for carefully selected patients (see Appendix C in the original guideline document) with a clinical diagnosis of pain originating from the lumbar facet joints:</p>
            <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
                <li>Intra-articular facet joint blocks </li>
                <li>Medial branch blocks (studies show benefit for up to 6 weeks, and sometimes longer) </li>
                <li>Medial branch neurotomy (studies demonstrate pain relief lasting longer than 3 months) </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The clinical diagnosis of facet joint pain lacks specificity and may be best determined by a trained spinal care specialist.</p>
            <p><em>The most commonly reported adverse events are</em>:</p>
            <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
                <li><em>Facet joint interventions: haematoma, steroid side effects, accidental dural puncture and infection.</em> </li>
                <li><em>Radiofrequency denervation: increased pain (usually temporary) due to neuritis, and cutaneous dysaesthesias.</em> </li>

<p><strong>Inclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p><em>Guidelines</em></p>
<p>Guidelines (&quot;seed&quot; guidelines) were included if they focused on the diagnosis, conservative nonsurgical treatment, or prevention of nonmalignant, nonspecific low back pain and were designed for use in primary healthcare settings by physicians, physical therapists, chiropractors, occupational therapists, psychologists, nurses, physiatrists, and other healthcare providers who treat patients with back pain.</p>
<p>Only clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) formulated in countries with developed market economies were included since the health status, cultural norms, access to health care, and disease burden of individuals from countries with transitional or developing economies were likely to be too different from those in Canada to be clinically relevant. Countries deemed to have developed economies, as defined by the United Nations, were Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the United States of America, and European countries (except for those with transition economies).</p>
<p><em>Patient Group</em></p>
<p>Patients included individuals who were 18 years of age or older. Guidelines that referred to adult patients without providing a specific age range were also included.</p>
<p><em>Condition</em></p>
<p>For guidelines on treatment and diagnosis, the duration of pain was defined as follows:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Acute and subacute pain: pain of less than 12 weeks' duration </li>
    <li>Chronic pain: pain of at least 12 weeks' duration </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>The following were excluded:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Guidelines focused on inpatient interventions, such as surgical treatments </li>
    <li>Guidelines focused on children or adolescents, pregnant women, or patients with specific causes for low back pain, such as referred pain (from abdomen, kidney, ovary, pelvis, bladder), inflammatory conditions (rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis), infections (postherpetic neuralgia, discitis, osteomyelitis, epidural abscess), degenerative and structural changes (spondylosis, spondylolisthesis, gross scoliosis, kyphosis), fracture, neoplasm, or metabolic bone disease (osteoporosis, osteomalacia, Paget's disease) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Literature Search Strategies</strong></p>
<p>For the first edition of the guideline, a preliminary systematic literature search was conducted to identify relevant guidelines published in English between January 1996 and February 2006. The search was further refined and updates were conducted in April 2006, October 2006, June 2007, and February 2008 (see Table 1 in the background document; and the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p>For the second edition of the guideline, these searches were updated to identify relevant guidelines published in English between January 2001 and June 2010. An additional update search was conducted in October 2010. The date restriction was applied to ensure that the guidelines collected were current and clinically relevant.</p>
<p>Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) relevant to this topic are: Low back pain, Back pain, Pain, Sacrococcygeal region, Sciatica.</p>
<p>In some cases, Update Committee members requested additional research evidence to finalize some of the guideline's recommendations. Hence, primary studies cited in the seed guidelines in support of their recommendations were retrieved for closer examination. For some of these recommendations, the database developed for the Ambassador Pilot Project, known as the Institute of Health Economics (IHE) database, was searched for systematic reviews, published in English between January 2002 and December 2010, that focused on specific interventions for low back pain. The search strategy for the systematic reviews in this database is outlined in Table 2 in the background document.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Do Not Know&quot; Recommendations and New Interventions</em></p>
<p>The IHE database was searched to identify recently published systematic reviews of new interventions that were considered important by the Steering Committee, the Update Committee, and members of the former Guideline Development Group (GDG) and Advisory Committee, but which were not covered in the first edition of the Alberta Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG). These included the following: lumbar discography as a diagnostic test, herbal medicine, aquatic exercise and spa therapy, yoga therapy, touch therapy, spinal decompression treatment/traction, low level laser therapy, radiofrequency neurotomy, intramuscular stimulation, and topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).</p>
<p>The IHE database was also searched to identify recently published systematic reviews on interventions from the first edition of the Alberta CPG that were demarcated with a recommendation category of &quot;do not know&quot; as follows:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Prevention of occurrence and recurrence of low back pain: lumbar support/back belts, manipulative treatment, mattresses, furniture&amp;mdash;chairs, risk factor modification </li>
    <li>Acute and subacute low back pain: acupuncture, therapeutic exercise </li>
    <li>Chronic low back pain: spinal manipulation </li>
</ul>
<p>See Table 2 in the background document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for more information.</p>
<p>Recently published systematic reviews were similarly sought for all of the drugs listed in the medication table from the first edition of the Alberta CPG.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Selecting the Seed Guidelines</strong></span></p>
<p>The initial selection of guidelines was made by one reviewer and double-checked by a second reviewer. Guidelines were excluded that, on the basis of their abstract, clearly did not meet the inclusion criteria. Copies of the full text of potentially eligible guidelines were retrieved. In some cases, closer examination of the full text revealed that the guideline did not meet the inclusion criteria. Consequently, these papers were excluded (see Appendix D in the background document [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). When a single guideline development group had published more than one guideline, only the most recent version was used.</p>
<p>In the first edition of the Alberta CPG, a dearth of guidelines on chronic low back pain led to the inclusion of two guidelines (Mercer et al. [2006], formerly G1, and Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement [2006], formerly G2) that did not match the definition of chronic low back pain&amp;mdash;both defined chronic pain as pain lasting 6 weeks or longer&amp;mdash;as listed in the inclusion criteria for the Alberta CPG (i.e., pain of at least 12 weeks' duration). Similarly, no new guidelines on chronic low back pain that matched the Alberta CPG definition were identified by the literature searches for the second edition of the Alberta CPG. Consequently, the Research Team included a recent comprehensive guideline by Savigny et al. (2009) for review by the Update Committee, which defined chronic pain as pain lasting more than 6 weeks. An update of the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (2008) guideline, which still defined chronic pain as pain lasting longer than 6 weeks, was also included for review by the Update Committee.</p>
<p>However, the Update Committee decided to exclude seed guidelines whose definition of chronic low back pain did not exactly match that of the Alberta CPG's inclusion criteria (see Appendix D, Table D.4 in the background document [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). Therefore, the two seed guidelines that were initially included in the first edition were also excluded by the Update Committee: Mercer et al. (2006), formerly G1, and the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (2006), formerly G2. The chronic pain recommendations that were derived from these two guidelines were subsequently removed from the second edition of the Alberta CPG. The guideline by Savigny et al. was also excluded. However, an exception was made for the updated version of the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (2008) guideline, which was included in the second edition of the Alberta CPG (only for acute low back pain) because its recommendations on acute/subacute low back pain had already been included in the first edition, and its definition for acute/subacute pain overlapped with that of the Alberta CPG.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Critically Appraising the Seed Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>The included guidelines were assessed with respect to various aspects of methodology and reporting using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument. Although a new edition of the tool, AGREE tool (II), was published in May 2009, to maintain consistency and continuity in the guideline appraisal process, the Research Team decided to continue using the original AGREE tool that had been used in the first edition of the Alberta Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG).</p>
<p>The Research Team modified the original AGREE tool to reduce the ambiguity and subjectivity associated with item scoring, and to enable the differentiation of good from poor quality guidelines. A detailed discussion of the modifications can be found in the background document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p>Seed guideline quality assessments were undertaken independently by two or three reviewers who discussed the modified AGREE dictionary with respect to the interpretation of questions prior to assessing the guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Critically Appraising the Systematic Reviews on New Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The Research Team critically appraised the systematic reviews found on the following new interventions, which were added to the Alberta CPG based on input from the Steering Committee, the Update Committee, and members of the former Guideline Development Group (GDG) and Advisory Committee: lumbar discography as a diagnostic test, herbal medicine, aquatic exercise, spa therapy, yoga therapy, touch therapy, spinal decompression treatment/traction, physiotherapist-provided operant conditioning, short wave diathermy, therapeutic ultrasound, low-level laser therapy, radiofrequency neurotomy, intramuscular stimulation, and topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The systematic reviews were assessed with respect to various aspects of methodology and reporting using an in-house quality appraisal checklist adapted from a number of sources (see Appendix F in the background document [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). The checklist was operationalized by constructing a dictionary that explained each criterion. The two reviewers discussed the dictionary with respect to the interpretation of questions prior to assessing the reviews.</p>
<p>The quality assessment was conducted independently by two reviewers. Any disagreements in scoring were resolved by discussion until consensus was reached. The systematic reviews were rated according to six essential quality criteria as good, average or poor. Critical appraisal results for all of the included reviews are tabulated in Appendix G in the background document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). Although the results of the quality appraisal were examined by the Steering Committee, interventions with poor-quality systematic review evidence were not excluded from the Alberta CPG.</p>
<p><strong>Extracting Data</strong></p>
<p>Two reviewers extracted guideline information into standardized evidence inventory tables that were developed a priori. However, duplicate data extraction and cross-checking were not performed. The evidence inventory tables included guideline profile information (title, country, and intervention category; e.g., prevention, acute and subacute, or chronic low back pain), a synopsis of the recommendations, and a list of the number and types of studies referenced by the guideline to support its recommendations. Discordant recommendations among guidelines were highlighted within the table.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Set-up and Planning of the Alberta Low Back Pain Guideline Update Process</strong></p>
<p>Several activities occurred in preparation for the second edition (or update) of the Alberta Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) for the Evidence-Informed Primary Care Management of Low Back Pain.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>At the completion of the first edition of the Alberta CPG in March 2009, an Update Committee was established to oversee the ongoing review and maintenance of the guideline. The committee included six former members of the Guideline Development Group (GDG) with expertise in the field (three physicians, one physical therapist, one pain specialist, and the clinical psychologist who chaired the GDG) plus two new members (one physician and one pharmacist) who had not been involved in the development of the first edition of the Alberta CPG. Toward Optimized Practice (TOP), the program responsible for provincial guidelines, and health technology assessment (HTA) researchers from the Institute of Health Economics were responsible for updating the scientific content of the Alberta CPG. The Steering Committee began outlining a schedule and process for updating the guideline in the fall of 2010. The Update Committee, which was co-chaired by two members (the clinical psychologist who chaired the GDG and a physician who participated in the GDG), became active in January 2011. </li>
    <li>A workshop titled &quot;Encouraging Optimal Use of Diagnostic Imaging for Low Back Pain&quot; was held on 26&amp;ndash;27 October 2010 to explore options for improving the quality of and access to diagnostic imaging services for low back pain in Alberta through the engagement of stakeholders involved in the assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and management of low back pain. Users of the Alberta CPG stated that the recommendations related to the use of diagnostic imaging were among the most difficult to implement in primary care practice, and that an updated version of the guideline might benefit from the input of radiologists. Feedback from workshop participants indicated the need to update the diagnostic imaging recommendations of the Alberta CPG. </li>
    <li>In November 2010, all former GDG and Advisory Committee members were asked to list any primary care assessments and treatments not included in the first edition of the guideline that may be relevant for patients with low back pain. The resulting list of assessments and interventions was initially reviewed by the two co-chairs of the Update Committee in December 2010, followed by full Update Committee review in January 2011. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General Process</strong></p>
<p>To simplify the task of reviewing the new research evidence, only those recommendations that were discordant with or contained more information than the Alberta CPG, or that were new (i.e., were not included in the first edition of the Alberta CPG), were tabulated in the evidence inventory tables. The recommendations from the first edition of the Alberta CPG were listed for reference alongside the new evidence, where applicable. Evidence inventory tables for the guidelines common to the first and second edition of the Alberta CPG can be found in Appendix G of the background document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for the first edition of this guideline: Institute of Health Economics (IHE). <em>Ambassador Program guideline for the evidence-informed primary care management of low back pain: background document</em>. Edmonton (AB): Institute of Health Economics; 2009, Revised 2010. Available from: <a href=&quot;http://www.ihe.ca/documents/Guideline100-pagerJune2010.pdf&quot; title=&quot;Institute of Health Economics Web site&quot;>www.ihe.ca/documents/Guideline100-pagerJune2010.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>The Update Committee reviewed all of the documents for the new seed guidelines (the guidelines plus their companion documents, evidence inventory tables, and Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation [AGREE] scores) and engaged in deliberations during three half-day meetings (two via WebEx and one face-to-face) over a 5-month period (January to May 2011) to review and update the Alberta CPG recommendations. In addition, two special topic meetings were held. The first involved one half-day, face-to-face meeting on 1 June 2011 to review and refine recommendations relating to clinical red flags and to referral for diagnostic imaging and surgical evaluation, to ensure they were relevant to Alberta practice. The meeting participants included one spine surgeon, three radiologists, four members of the Update Committee, and one member of the Research Team. In preparation for this meeting, two additional reviewers from the Institute for Work &amp;amp; Health, Ontario, were asked to use the modified AGREE tool to appraise a guideline from the Canadian Association of Radiologists that had been excluded during the seed guideline selection process (see Appendix D, Table D.3 of the background document [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]) This was done to ensure that the decision to exclude this national guideline was not biased, and to provide some external validation of the critical appraisal methodology used in the development of the Alberta CPG (see Appendix I, Table I.2 of the background document [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]).</p>
<p>The second special topic meeting involved a 2-hour teleconference on 3 August 2011 to review any published systematic reviews relating to the pharmaceutical interventions listed in the Alberta CPG, with the aim of updating the information contained in the medication table. The meeting participants included four members of the Update Committee (three family physicians and one osteopathic physician), one pharmacist who was not a member of the Update Committee, and one member of the Research Team. Two other pharmacists, one of whom was not a member of the Update Committee, provided feedback via e-mail.</p>
<p>The agenda and all documents were provided in advance for each meeting, and participants had the option of joining the face-to-face meetings via telephone if they could not attend in person. Each of the meetings was guided by one or both of the co-chairs. To expedite the process, multiple subcommittee meetings were organized to review the new research evidence and draft recommendations prior to the Update Committee meetings. Frequent &quot;roundtables&quot; were conducted during each meeting to ensure that all participants had a voice in the proceedings, and process reviews were instigated at strategic points throughout. All final decisions were made by consensus.</p>
<p>In many cases, additional evidence was required when uncertainties or disagreements arose regarding interpretation of the evidence from the seed guidelines or when new interventions that were not included in the first edition of the guideline were considered. These requests by the Update Committee, named &quot;parking lot&quot; items, encompassed the examination of individual research studies cited by the seed guidelines as well as additional systematic reviews on low back pain identified by a supplementary literature search conducted between January 2002 and December 2010. The parking lot items were referred for further analysis to ad hoc subcommittees comprising the co-chairs of the Update Committee, one HTA researcher, and at least one volunteer from the Update Committee with expertise in the relevant area. Consensus-based decisions made by the subcommittees were then presented to the Update Committee for final approval. Information about the parking lot items and other miscellaneous requests made by the Update Committee, the deliberations of the subcommittees, and the dates when the actions and final approval of the recommendations took place are provided in Appendix K of the background document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong>Rationale and Process for Developing Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Each recommendation from the Alberta CPG was sourced from one or multiple seed guidelines and was accepted, supplemented, or changed as follows.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Accepted, or accepted with minor modification (e.g., wording) </li>
    <li>Accepted, but supplemented with expert opinion </li>
    <li>Additional information retrieved/considered:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Accepted/changed original recommendation based only on studies included in seed guideline </li>
        <li>Accepted/changed original recommendation based on additional evidence from systematic review literature search </li>
        <li>Supplemented additional evidence with expert opinion </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>In wording the recommendations, the Update Committee, Steering Committee, and Research Team considered the GuideLine Implementability Appraisal (GLIA) tool, which is designed for appraising the implementability of CPGs. It explores different dimensions of individual recommendations, such as decidability, executability, effect on process of care, presentation and formatting, measurable outcomes, apparent validity, novelty/innovation, flexibility, and computability.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Economic Implications Reported in the Seed Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>Formal economic evaluations or cost analyses were not included in any of the seed guidelines. The following statements were made in the seed guidelines regarding the economic implications of their recommendations (see the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field to identify the seed guidelines).</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Proper information (information/education/training [back schools]) may reduce the cost of back problems. The power of written information is relatively weak, but it may be cost-effective due to its low per-person costs. Regarding information from general activities of the media, cost-benefit aspects need to be considered, because a higher intensity delivery may have a higher impact on the recipient but is likely to be more expensive. Therefore, local circumstances and needs must be considered. Currently, insufficient evidence is available from randomized controlled trials and reviews to give specific recommendations. (G5) </li>
    <li>Self-care education books based on evidence-based guidelines are recommended because they are an inexpensive and efficient method for supplementing clinician-provided back information and advice and are similar or only slightly inferior in effectiveness to such costlier interventions as supervised exercise therapy, acupuncture, massage, and spinal manipulation. (G1) </li>
    <li>There is no evidence that risk factor modification will reduce the incidence, prevalence, or socioeconomic costs of low back pain. (G5) </li>
    <li>Substitution of rapid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for X-ray evaluations in the primary care setting may offer little additional benefit to patients, and it may increase the costs of care because of the increased number of spine operations that patients are likely to undergo (G4, G8). Because of its high cost, the use of MRI cannot be justified for the screening of acute low back pain. (G7) </li>
    <li>Selection of appropriate radiologic imaging procedures for evaluation of patients with musculoskeletal disorders of the spine decreases costs and unnecessary ionizing radiation exposure and improves accessibility. In adult patients with acute, uncomplicated low back pain (less than 4 weeks' duration), routine use of lumbar spine conventional radiography is not indicated because of the very low incidence of unexpected findings on radiographs (only 1 in 2500 radiographs), the high radiation dose to gonads, the high cost/benefit ratio, and the poor association between patient findings and low back pain (i.e., not specific). MRI or computed tomography (CT) is useful in the detection of problems with bone and soft tissue structures. The choice of study depends on the current clinical question, availability of equipment, and costs. CT is more available and less costly. (G2b) </li>
    <li>Several classes of medications have been shown to have moderate, primarily short-term benefits for patients with low back pain. Each class of medication is associated with unique trade-offs involving benefits, risks, and costs. For example, acetaminophen is a slightly weaker analgesic than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (10 points on a 100-point visual analogue pain scale), but is a reasonable first-line option for treatment of acute or chronic low back pain because of its more favorable safety profile and low cost. Factors that should be considered when weighing medications for low back pain include the presence of risk factors for complications, concomitant medication use, baseline severity of pain, duration of low back symptoms, and cost. (G1) </li>
    <li>Some interventions (such as intensive, interdisciplinary rehabilitation) may not be available in all settings, and costs for similarly effective interventions can vary substantially. (G1) </li>
</ul>
<p>The following cost-effectiveness recommendations are provided in the seed guidelines.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Published data are very limited, but there is some evidence that advice to maintain usual activities, the provision of an education booklet, and participation in community-based exercises are cost-effective first-line interventions for acute low back pain. An exercise program is more cost-effective than usual care, with lower direct and indirect costs (as measured by days of work lost). (G7) </li>

<p>The first edition of the Alberta CPG for the Evidence-Informed Primary Care Management of Low Back Pain (summary, guideline, and companion documents) was reviewed by various stakeholders (professionals with experience and interest in pain management, members of the GDG and their colleagues, and patients with acute and chronic low back pain) as well as two independent methodologists with expertise in guideline development. The Steering Committee and Research Team collated all feedback and incorporated it, where possible, into the Alberta CPG.</p>
<p>For the second edition of the Alberta CPG, the Update Committee and healthcare practitioners from the Toward Optimized Practice (TOP) dissemination list were asked to provide feedback on the clarity of the recommendations, particularly the new and revised sections of the guideline, and their implementability in practice and, more generally, in the Alberta healthcare environment. A web-based survey form was created to assist in providing feedback. One family physician, one specialist physician, two physical therapists/rehabilitation professionals, and one psychologist, from four of the five Alberta Health Services zones (i.e., North, Edmonton, Calgary, and South) provided feedback. A sample of the survey and of the responses is provided in Appendix R of the background document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p>A pilot study was conducted in August 2011 among 83 physical therapy students at the University of Alberta who were in the final year of their Masters in Physical Therapy program. The aim was to evaluate the utility of measuring awareness of and adherence to the Alberta CPG among physical therapists using previously validated vignettes. Seventy-five students responded, of whom 43 commented on the usefulness of the guideline: it received an average rating of 5 out of 10 (scale ranged from 0 = not useful to 10 = extremely useful). The following suggestions for improving the guideline were provided: disseminate it widely and make it more available (n=5); use the guideline as a teaching resource in the physiotherapy curriculum (n=4); publish the guideline on a professional website (n=1); and enhance the treatment options available in the guideline (n=1).</p>
<p>The Alberta CPG for the Evidence-Informed Primary Care Management of Low Back Pain, 2nd Edition, has been endorsed by the TOP program, which is funded under the Master Agreement between the Alberta Medical Association (AMA), Alberta Health Services, and Alberta Health. TOP is administered by the AMA.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation Strategy&amp;mdash;Guideline Development Process</strong></p>
<p>The Ambassador adaptation process used to develop the first edition of the Alberta CPG was evaluated by an independent management consultancy firm in 2009. The evaluation aimed to identify the major challenges and successful strategies associated with the process; to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the process by benchmarking it against the ADAPTE framework, and to identify opportunities for improvement in future iterations of the adaptation process.</p>
<p>A comparison of the process, tools, and deliverables revealed a high degree of alignment between the Ambassador process and the ADAPTE framework. However, the Ambassador Program adaptation process differed from the ADAPTE method in several ways: a novel process was used to recruit GDG members; a more complex committee structure with altered responsibilities was used; the AGREE tool was modified to reduce the ambiguity and subjectivity of item scoring; more detailed evidence inventory tables were created; ad hoc GDG subcommittees were used to systematically review additional research evidence when necessary; standardized definitions were constructed for the types of recommendations made in the Alberta CPG (e.g., what constituted a &quot;do&quot; or &quot;do not do&quot; recommendation) from the overlapping evidence rating scales used by the seed guidelines; the principles of the GuideLine Implementability Appraisal tool (GLIA) were used to &quot;word-smith&quot; the final recommendations; and a more comprehensive process was used to gather feedback on the draft guideline. There was strong consensus among the 29 stakeholder interviewed in the evaluation that the process used to develop the Alberta CPG was sound and rigorous.</p>
<p>An evaluation of the updating process used to construct the second edition of the Alberta CPG will not be conducted.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The type of supporting evidence is identified for each recommendation (see the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field).</p>
<p>The Evidence Source provides information on the &quot;seed&quot; guideline(s) that were used to develop the Alberta guideline recommendations and the design of the studies referenced by the seed guideline(s) in support of their recommendations.</p>
<p>The following evidence sources were considered:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>SR</strong> (systematic review): as cited by the seed guideline(s) or identified from a supplementary literature search (Institute of Health Economics [IHE] Database) required by the Ambassador Guideline Development Group (GDG). The literature search spanned from January 1996 to August 2007 for the first edition of this guideline and from January 2002 to December 2010 for the second edition. </li>
    <li><strong>RCT</strong> (randomized controlled trial): as cited by the seed guideline(s) </li>
    <li><strong>CS</strong> (case series): as cited by the seed guideline(s) </li>
    <li><strong>G</strong> (guideline): as cited by the seed guideline(s) </li>
    <li><strong>EO</strong> (expert opinion<strong> </strong>as cited by the seed guideline[s]): when no evidence was provided by the &quot;seed&quot; guideline(s) in support of the recommendation </li>
    <li><strong>EO (GDG)</strong>: after examining other references nominated by GDG members (i.e., SRs or Gs which defined chronic pain as &amp;gt;6 weeks' duration) or when no evidence from SRs was found on an intervention, a new recommendation was drafted based on the collective EO of the Ambassador GDG. </li>
</ul>
<p>For evidence cited by the seed guideline(s), only the highest level of evidence was listed. For example, when the evidence cited by a seed guideline was from SRs and studies of other design (i.e., RCT, CS, or G) only SR is listed as the source. When no SR was referenced in the seed guideline, the evidence source was indicated in the following order: RCT, CS, G, EO. The same classification for the evidence source was applied when multiple seed guidelines were used to inform one recommendation.</p>
<p>Each recommendation in the Alberta guideline came from one or more seed guidelines or SRs (IHE Database) was created by the GDG, based on their collective professional opinion and an analysis of relevant evidence.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Heat or Cold Packs</strong></p>
<p>Heat or cold should not be applied directly to the skin and not for longer than 15 to 20 minutes. Use with care if lack of protective sensation.</p>
<p><strong>Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)</strong></p>
<p>Serious adverse effects of NSAIDs include gastrointestinal complications (e.g., bleeding, perforation and increased blood pressure). Mild-to-moderately severe side-effects of NSAIDs include abdominal pain, diarrhea, edema, dry mouth, rash, dizziness, headache, tiredness. There is no clear difference between different types of NSAIDs.</p>
<p><strong>Opioids</strong></p>
<p>In general, opioids and compound analgesics have a substantially increased risk for side effects compared with acetaminophen alone. Opioid side-effects (including headache, nausea, somnolence, constipation, dry mouth, and dizziness) should be high in the differential diagnosis of new complaints.</p>
<p><strong>Injection Therapy</strong></p>
<p>The most commonly reported adverse events are:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Facet joint interventions: haematoma, steroid side effects, accidental dural puncture and infection </li>
    <li>Radiofrequency denervation: increased pain (usually temporary) due to neuritis, and cutaneous dysaesthesias </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Epidural Steroids</strong></p>
<p>Transient minor complications include: headache, nausea, pruritus, increased pain of sciatic distribution, and puncture of the dura. Adverse effects of epidural steroids in the presence of radiculopathy are infrequent and include headache, fever, subdural penetration and more rarely epidural abscess and ventilatory depression.</p>
<p><strong>Therapeutic Exercise</strong></p>
<p>Patients should discontinue any activity or exercise that causes spread of symptoms (peripheralization). Self-treating with an exercise program not specifically designed for the patient may aggravate symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Exercise</strong></p>
<p>Some studies report mild negative reactions to exercise programs such as increased low back pain and muscle soreness in some patients.</p>
<p><strong>Yoga Therapy</strong></p>
<p>It is important for find an instructor who has experience in working with individuals who have low back pain to avoid further injury.</p>
<p><strong>Acupuncture</strong></p>
<p>No serious adverse events were reported in the trials. The incidence of minor adverse events was 5% in the acupuncture group (see the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field). </p>
<p><strong>Muscle Relaxants</strong></p>
<p>Drowsiness, dizziness and dependency are common adverse effects of muscle relaxants. Caution must be exercised with managing side effects, particularly drowsiness, and also with patient selection, given the abuse potential for this class of drugs.</p>
<p><strong>Antidepressants</strong></p>
<p>Possible side-effects include drowsiness and anticholinergic effects.</p>
<p><strong>Prolotherapy</strong></p>
<p>The most commonly reported adverse events were temporary increases in back pain and stiffness following injections. Some patients had severe headaches suggestive of lumbar puncture, but no serious or permanent adverse events were reported.</p>
<p><strong>Herbal Medicines</strong></p>
<p>Devil's claw was associated with the following adverse events: repeated coughs, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal upset. Use of Capsicum frutescens plaster was associated with inflammatory contact eczema, urticaria, minute hemorrhagic spots, vesiculation or dermatitis, sensation of warmth locally and pruritus.</p>
<p><strong>Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)</strong></p>
<p>Skin irritation is a common adverse event.</p>
