<p><strong>Treatment of the Initial Episode of SSNS</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or prednisolone)* be given for at least 12 weeks. (<em><strong>1B</strong></em>)
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>The Work Group recommends that oral prednisone be administered as a single daily dose (<strong><em>1B</em></strong>) starting at 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/d or 2 mg/kg/d to a maximum 60 mg/d. (<em><strong>1D</strong></em>) </li>
        <li>The Work Group recommends that daily oral prednisone be given for 4&amp;ndash;6 weeks (<em><strong>1C</strong></em>) followed by alternate-day medication as a single daily dose starting at 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> or 1.5 mg/kg (maximum 40 mg on alternate days) (<strong><em>1D</em></strong>) and continued for 2&amp;ndash;5 months with tapering of the dose. (<em><strong>1B</strong></em>) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatment of Relapsing SSNS with Corticosteroids</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Corticosteroid therapy for children with infrequent relapses of SSNS:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>The Work Group suggests that infrequent relapses of SSNS in children be treated with a single-daily dose of prednisone 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> or 2 mg/kg (maximum of 60 mg/d) until the child has been in complete remission for at least 3 days. (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>) </li>
        <li>The Work Group suggests that, after achieving complete remission, children be given prednisone as a single dose on alternate days (40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per dose or 1.5 mg/kg per dose: maximum 40 mg on alternate days) for at least 4 weeks. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Corticosteroid therapy for frequently relapsing (FR) and steroid-dependent (SD) SSNS:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>The Work Group suggests that relapses in children with FR or SD SSNS be treated with daily prednisone until the child has been in remission for at least 3 days, followed by alternate-day prednisone for at least 3 months. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>) </li>
        <li>The Work Group suggests that prednisone be given on alternate days in the lowest dose to maintain remission without major adverse effects in children with FR and SD SSNS. (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>) </li>
        <li>The Work Group suggests that daily prednisone at the lowest dose be given to maintain remission without major adverse effects in children with SD SSNS where alternate-day prednisone therapy is not effective. (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>) </li>
        <li>The Work Group suggests that daily prednisone be given during episodes of upper respiratory tract and other infections to reduce the risk for relapse in children with FR and SD SSNS already on alternate-day prednisone. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*Prednisone and prednisolone are equivalent, used in the same dosage, and have both been used in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) depending on the country of origin. All later references to prednisone in this section refer to prednisone or prednisolone. All later references to oral corticosteroids refer to prednisone or prednisolone.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment of FR and SD SSNS with Corticosteroid-Sparing Agents</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that corticosteroid-sparing agents be prescribed for children with FR SSNS and SD SSNS, who develop steroid-related adverse effects. (<em><strong>1B</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that alkylating agents, cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil, be given as corticosteroid-sparing agents for FR SSNS. (<strong><em>1B</em></strong>) The Work Group suggests that alkylating agents, cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil, be given as corticosteroid-sparing agents for SD SSNS. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>)
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>The Work Group suggests that cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/d) be given for 8&amp;ndash;12 weeks (maximum cumulative dose 168 mg/kg). (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>) </li>
        <li>The Work Group suggests that cyclophosphamide not be started until the child has achieved remission with corticosteroids. (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>) </li>
        <li>The Work Group suggests that chlorambucil (0.1&amp;ndash;0.2 mg/kg/d) may be given for 8 weeks (maximum cumulative dose 11.2 mg/kg) as an alternative to cyclophosphamide. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>) </li>
        <li>The Work Group suggests that second courses of alkylating agents not be given. (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that levamisole be given as a corticosteroid-sparing agent. (<em><strong>1B</strong></em>)
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>The Work Group suggests that levamisole be given at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg on alternate days (<em><strong>2B</strong></em>) for at least 12 months (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>) as most children will relapse when levamisole is stopped. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine or tacrolimus be given as corticosteroid-sparing agents. (<em><strong>1C</strong></em>)
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>The Work Group suggests that cyclosporine be administered at a dose of 4&amp;ndash;5 mg/kg/d (starting dose) in two divided doses. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>) </li>
        <li>The Work Group suggests that tacrolimus 0.1 mg/kg/d (starting dose) given in two divided doses be used instead of cyclosporine when the cosmetic side-effects of cyclosporine are unacceptable. (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>) </li>
        <li>Monitor CNI levels during therapy to limit toxicity. (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>) </li>
        <li>The Work Group suggests that CNIs be given for at least 12 months, as most children will relapse when CNIs are stopped. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests that mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) be given as a corticosteroid-sparing agent. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>)
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>The Work Group suggests that MMF (starting dose 1200 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/d) be given in two divided doses for at least 12 months, as most children will relapse when MMF is stopped. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests that rituximab be considered only in children with SD SSNS who have continuing frequent relapses despite optimal combinations of prednisone and corticosteroid-sparing agents, and/or who have serious adverse effects of therapy. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests that mizoribine not be used as a corticosteroid-sparing agent in FR and SD SSNS. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that azathioprine not be used as a corticosteroid-sparing agent in FR and SD SSNS. (<em><strong>1B</strong></em>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Indication for Kidney Biopsy</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Indications for kidney biopsy in children with SSNS are (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>):
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Late failure to respond following initial response to corticosteroids </li>
        <li>A high index of suspicion for a different underlying pathology </li>
        <li>Decreasing kidney function in children receiving CNIs </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Immunizations in Children with SSNS</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>To reduce the risk of serious infections in children with SSNS (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>):
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Give pneumococcal vaccination to the children. </li>
        <li>Give influenza vaccination annually to the children and their household contacts. </li>
        <li>Defer vaccination with live vaccines until prednisone dose is below either 1 mg/kg daily (&amp;lt;20 mg/d) or 2 mg/kg on alternate days (&amp;lt;40 mg on alternate days). </li>
        <li>Live vaccines are contraindicated in children receiving corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents. </li>
        <li>Immunize healthy household contacts with live vaccines to minimize the risk of transfer of infection to the immunosuppressed child but avoid direct exposure of the child to gastrointestinal, urinary, or respiratory secretions of vaccinated contacts for 3&amp;ndash;6 weeks after vaccination. </li>
        <li>Following close contact with Varicella infection, give nonimmune children on immunosuppressive agents varicella zoster immune globulin, if available. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Steroid-Resistant Nephrotic Syndrome (SRNS) in Children</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Evaluation of Children with SRNS</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The Work Group suggests a minimum of 8 weeks treatment with corticosteroids to define steroid resistance. (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>The following are required to evaluate the child with SRNS (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>):
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>A diagnostic kidney biopsy </li>
        <li>Evaluation of kidney function by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or estimated GFR (eGFR) </li>
        <li>Quantitation of urine protein excretion </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatment Recommendations for SRNS</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The Work Group recommends using a CNI as initial therapy for children with SRNS. (<em><strong>1B</strong></em>)
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>The Work Group suggests that CNI therapy be continued for a minimum of 6 months and then stopped if a partial or complete remission of proteinuria is not achieved. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>) </li>

<p><strong>Class III LN (Focal LN) and Class IV LN (Diffuse LN)&amp;mdash;Initial Therapy</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The Work Group recommends initial therapy with corticosteroids (<em><strong>1A</strong></em>), combined with either cyclophosphamide (<em><strong>1B</strong></em>) or MMF (<em><strong>1B</strong></em>). </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests that, if patients have worsening LN (rising SCr, worsening proteinuria) during the first 3 months of treatment, a change be made to an alternative recommended initial therapy, or a repeat kidney biopsy be performed to guide further treatment. (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Class III LN (Focal LN) and Class IV LN (Diffuse LN)&amp;mdash;Maintenance Therapy</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that, after initial therapy is complete, patients with class III and IV LN receive maintenance therapy with azathioprine (1.5&amp;ndash;2.5 mg/kg/d) or MMF (1&amp;ndash;2 g/d in divided doses), and low-dose oral corticosteroids (&amp;le;10 mg/d prednisone equivalent). (<em><strong>1B</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests that CNIs with low-dose corticosteroids be used for maintenance therapy in patients who are intolerant of MMF and azathioprine. (<strong><em>2C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests that, after complete remission is achieved, maintenance therapy be continued for at least 1 year before consideration is given to tapering the immunosuppression. (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>If complete remission has not been achieved after 12 months of maintenance therapy, consider performing a repeat kidney biopsy before determining if a change in therapy is indicated. (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>While maintenance therapy is being tapered, if kidney function deteriorates and/or proteinuria worsens, the Work Group suggests that treatment be increased to the previous level of immunosuppression that controlled the LN. (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Class V LN (Membranous LN)</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that patients with class V LN, normal kidney function, and non&amp;ndash;nephrotic-range proteinuria be treated with antiproteinuric and antihypertensive medications, and only receive corticosteroids and immunosuppressives as dictated by the extrarenal manifestations of systemic lupus. (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests that patients with pure class V LN and persistent nephrotic proteinuria be treated with corticosteroids plus an additional immunosuppressive agent: cyclophosphamide (<strong><em>2C</em></strong>), or CNI (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>), or MMF (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>), or azathioprine (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General Treatment of LN</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Class VI LN (Advanced Sclerosis LN)</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>

</ul>
<p><strong>Relapse of LN</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The Work Group suggests that a relapse of LN after complete or partial remission be treated with the initial therapy followed by the maintenance therapy that was effective in inducing the original remission. (<em><strong>2B</strong></em>)
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>If resuming the original therapy would put the patient at risk for excessive lifetime cyclophosphamide exposure, then the Work Group suggests a non&amp;ndash;cyclophosphamide-based initial regimen be used (see Regimen D, Table 28 in the original guideline document). (<em><strong>2B</strong></em>) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Consider a repeat kidney biopsy during relapse if there is suspicion that the histologic class of LN has changed, or there is uncertainty whether a rising SCr and/or worsening proteinuria represents disease activity or chronicity. (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatment of Resistant Disease</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>In patients with worsening SCr and/or proteinuria after completing one of the initial treatment regimens, consider performing a repeat kidney biopsy to distinguish active LN from scarring. (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>) </li>

    <li>The Work Group suggests that nonresponders who have failed more than one of the recommended initial regimens (see 'Class III LN [Focal LN] and Class IV LN [Diffuse LN]&amp;mdash;Initial Therapy,' above) may be considered for treatment with rituximab, i.v. immunoglobulin, or CNIs. (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Systemic Lupus and Thrombotic Microangiopathy</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The Work Group suggests that the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) involving the kidney in systemic lupus patients, with or without LN, be treated by anticoagulation (target international normalized ratio [INR] 2&amp;ndash;3). (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests that patients with systemic lupus and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) receive plasma exchange as for patients with TTP without systemic lupus. (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Systemic Lupus and Pregnancy</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>

    <li>The Work Group suggests that hydroxychloroquine be continued during pregnancy. (<em><strong>2B</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that LN patients who become pregnant while being treated with MMF be switched to azathioprine. (<em><strong>1B</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that, if LN patients relapse during pregnancy, they receive treatment with corticosteroids and, depending on the severity of the relapse, azathioprine. (<em><strong>1B</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>If pregnant patients are receiving corticosteroids or azathioprine, the Work Group suggests that these drugs not be tapered during pregnancy or for at least 3 months after delivery. (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests administration of low-dose aspirin during pregnancy to decrease the risk of fetal loss. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>LN in Children</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>

    <li>The Work Group recommends that cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids be used as initial treatment. (<em><strong>1A</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that rituximab and corticosteroids be used as an alternative initial treatment in patients without severe disease or in whom cyclophosphamide is contraindicated. (<em><strong>1B</strong></em>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Special Patient Populations</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The Work Group recommends the addition of plasmapheresis for patients requiring dialysis or with rapidly increasing SCr. (<em><strong>1C</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests the addition of plasmapheresis for patients with diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests the addition of plasmapheresis for patients with overlap syndrome of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) vasculitis and anti-GBM GN, according to proposed criteria and regimen for anti-GBM GN (see 'Treatment of Anti-Glomerular Basement Membrane Antibody Glomerulonephritis,' below) (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>) </li>

    <li>The Work Group recommends no maintenance therapy in patients who are dialysis-dependent and have no extrarenal manifestations of disease. (<em><strong>1C</strong></em>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Choice of Agent for Maintenance Therapy</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The Work Group recommends azathioprine 1&amp;ndash;2 mg/kg/d orally as maintenance therapy. (<em><strong>1B</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests that MMF, up to 1 g twice daily, be used for maintenance therapy in patients who are allergic to, or intolerant of, azathioprine. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as an adjunct to maintenance therapy in patients with upper respiratory tract disease. (<em><strong>2B</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests methotrexate (initially 0.3 mg/kg/wk, maximum 25 mg/wk) for maintenance therapy in patients intolerant of azathioprine and MMF, but not if GFR is &amp;lt;60 ml/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. (<em><strong>1C</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends not using etanercept as adjunctive therapy. (<em><strong>1A</strong></em>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatment of Relapse</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The Work Group recommends treating patients with severe relapse of ANCA vasculitis (life- or organ-threatening) according to the same guidelines as for the initial therapy (see 'Initial Treatment of Pauci-Immune Focal and Segmental Necrotizing GN,' above). (<em><strong>1C</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests treating other relapses of ANCA vasculitis by reinstituting immunosuppressive therapy or increasing its intensity with agents other than cyclophosphamide, including instituting or increasing dose of corticosteroids, with or without azathioprine or MMF. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatment of Resistant Disease</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>In ANCA GN resistant to induction therapy with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids, the Work Group recommends the addition of rituximab (<em><strong>1C</strong></em>), and suggest i.v. immunoglobulin (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>) or plasmapheresis (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>) as alternatives. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Monitoring</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>

<p><strong>Treatment of Anti-GBM GN</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The Work Group recommends initiating immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids plus plasmapheresis (see Table 31 in the original guideline document) in all patients with anti-GBM GN except those who are dialysis-dependent at presentation and have 100% crescents in an adequate biopsy sample, and do not have pulmonary hemorrhage. (<em><strong>1B</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>Start treatment for anti-GBM GN without delay once the diagnosis is confirmed.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Literature Searches and Article Selection</strong></p>
<p>Searches were conducted in MEDLINE and Cochrane through January 20, 2011. All searches were also supplemented by articles identified by Work Group members through November 2011. For detailed search strategies, please see the Online Appendix 1 (see the 'Availability of Companion Documents' field).</p>
<p>Search results were screened by the Evidence Review Team (ERT) for relevance using predefined eligibility criteria, described below. For questions related to treatment, the systematic search aimed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as described in Table 32 in the original guideline document. For some topics, randomized comparative trials were also reviewed, in addition to RCTs, to strengthen the evidence base.</p>
<p>For most topics, the minimum sample size was &amp;gt;10. For minimal-change disease (MCD) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), because of sparse data, smaller studies were included.</p>
<p>For most topics, the minimum duration of follow-up of 6 months was chosen based on clinical reasoning. For the treatments of interest, the proposed effects on patient important clinical outcomes require long-term exposure and, typically, would not be expected to become evident before several months of follow-up.</p>
<p>In addition, a search was conducted for data on predictors of kidney failure, kidney function, and remission. Only associations from multivariable regression analyses were considered. These 'predictor studies' were not graded for quality. For these topics, the ERT completed its search in October 5, 2009 and did not update the search.</p>
<p>Included were studies of all patients with glomerular diseases, excluding those with diabetic nephropathy, thrombotic microangiopathy, amyloidosis, Alport's and other hereditary glomerular diseases, paraproteinemia, and recurrence of glomerulonephritis (GN) following kidney transplantation.</p>
<p>Interventions of interest included all treatments for GN, including drugs, herbs, dietary supplements, tonsillectomy, infection prophylaxis, and postdiagnosis tests to determine treatment.</p>
<p>A list of pertinent, published systematic reviews relevant to GN guidelines was generated, organized by topic, and reviewed with the Work Group. If an existing systematic review adequately addressed a question of interest as determined by the Work Group, this was used instead of a <em>de novo</em> systematic review by the ERT. These systematic reviews were then used as the starting points for building the evidence base and supplemented with articles from the ERT's own searches. If these reviews were deemed to adequately address topics of interest (even if only selected outcomes were reviewed), <em>de novo</em> searches on these topics were limited to the time period since the end of literature search within the systematic reviews.</p>
<p>Editorials, letters, stand-alone abstracts, unpublished reports, and articles published in non&amp;ndash;peer-reviewed journals were excluded. The Work Group also decided to exclude publications from journal supplements.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations of Approach</strong></p>
<p>While the literature searches were intended to be comprehensive, they were not exhaustive. MEDLINE and various Cochrane databases were the only databases searched. Hand searches of journals were not performed, and review articles and textbook chapters were not systematically searched. However, important studies known to the domain experts that were missed by the electronic literature searches were added to retrieved articles and reviewed by the Work Group. Not all topics and subtopics covered by these guidelines could be systematically reviewed. Decisions to restrict the topics were made to focus the systematic reviews on those topics where existing evidence was thought to be likely to provide support for the guidelines. Although nonrandomized studies were reviewed, the majority of the ERT and Work Group resources were devoted to review of the randomized trials, since these were deemed to be most likely to provide data to support level 1 recommendations with very high- or high- (A or B) quality evidence. Where randomized trials were lacking, it was deemed to be sufficiently unlikely that studies previously unknown to the Work Group would result in higher-quality level 1 recommendations.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Data Extraction</strong></p>
<p>The Evidence Review Team (ERT) designed data-extraction forms to tabulate information on various aspects of the primary studies. Data fields for all topics included study setting, patient demographics, eligibility criteria, type of glomerulonephritis (GN), numbers of subjects randomized, study design, study funding source, descriptions of interventions (or predictors), description of outcomes, statistical methods used, results, quality of outcomes (as described below), limitations to generalizability, and free-text fields for comments and assessment of biases.</p>
<p><strong>Summary Tables</strong></p>
<p>Summary tables were developed to tabulate the data from studies pertinent to each question of intervention. Each summary table contains a brief description of the outcome, baseline characteristics of the population, intervention, comparator results, and methodological quality of each outcome. Baseline characteristics include a description of the study size, country of residence, and baseline kidney function and proteinuria. Intervention and concomitant therapies, and the results, were all captured. The studies were listed by outcome within the table, based on the hierarchy of important outcomes (see Table 34 in the original guideline document). Categorical and continuous outcomes were summarized in separate sets of tables. Work Group members were asked to proof all data in summary tables on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs. Separate sets of summary tables were created for predictor studies. Summary tables are available at <a href=&quot;http://www.kdigo.org/clinical_practice_guidelines/GN.php&quot; title=&quot;KDIGO Web site&quot;>www.kdigo.org/clinical_practice_guidelines/GN.php</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Profiles</strong></p>
<p>Evidence profiles were constructed by the ERT and reviewed and confirmed with the Work Group members. These profiles serve to make transparent to the reader the thinking process of the Work Group in systematically combining evidence and judgments. Each evidence profile was reviewed by Work Group members. Decisions were based on facts and findings from the primary studies listed in corresponding summary tables, as well as selected existing systematic reviews, and judgments of the Work Group. Judgments about the quality, consistency, and directness of evidence were often complex, as were judgments about the importance of an outcome or the summary of effects sizes. The evidence profiles provided a structured transparent approach to grading, rather than a rigorous method of quantitatively summing up grades. Evidence profiles were constructed for research questions addressed by at least two studies. When the body of evidence for a particular comparison of interest consisted of only one study, either an RCT or a systematic review, the summary table provides the final level of synthesis.</p>
<p><strong>Grading the Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>A structured approach, based on Grading Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) and facilitated by the use of evidence profiles, was used in order to grade the quality of the overall evidence. For each topic, the discussion on grading of the quality of the evidence was led by the ERT. The 'quality of a body of evidence' refers to the extent to which the confidence in an estimate of effect is sufficient to support a particular recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Grading the Quality of Evidence for Each Outcome</strong></p>
<p>Following the GRADE method, the quality of a body of evidence pertaining to a particular outcome of interest was initially categorized based on study design. For questions of interventions, the initial quality grade was 'High' when the body of evidence consisted of RCTs. In theory, the initial grade would have been 'Low' if the evidence consisted of observational studies or 'Very Low' if it consisted of studies of other study designs; however, the quality of bodies of evidence was formally determined only for topics where we performed systematic reviews of RCTs. The grade for the quality of evidence for each intervention/outcome pair was decreased if there were serious limitations to the methodological quality of the aggregate of studies, if there were important inconsistencies in the results across studies, if there was uncertainty about the directness of evidence including limited applicability of the findings to the population of interest, if the data were imprecise (a low event rate [0 or 1 event] in either arm or CI spanning a range &amp;lt;0.5 to &amp;gt;2.0) or sparse (only one study or total N&amp;lt;100), or if there was thought to be a high likelihood of bias. The final grade for the quality of the evidence for an intervention/outcome pair could be one of the following four grades: 'High', 'Moderate', 'Low', or 'Very Low' (see the 'Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence' field). The quality of grading for topics relying on systematic reviews are based on quality items recorded in the systematic review.</p>
<p><strong>Grading the Overall Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The quality of the overall body of evidence was then determined based on the quality grades for all outcomes of interest, taking into account explicit judgments about the relative importance of each outcome, weighting critical outcomes more than high or moderate. The resulting four final categories for the quality of overall evidence were: 'A', 'B', 'C' or 'D' (see the 'Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence' field). This evidence grade is indicated within each recommendation.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Overview of Process</strong></p>
<p>The Work Group, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Co-Chairs, the Evidence Review Team (ERT), and National Kidney Foundation (NKF) support staff met for three 3-day meetings for training in the guideline development process, topic discussion, and consensus development.</p>
<p><strong>Creation of Groups</strong></p>
<p>The KDIGO Co-Chairs appointed the Co-Chairs of the Work Group, who then assembled the Work Group to be responsible for the development of the guidelines. The Work Group included individuals with expertise in adult and pediatric nephrology, epidemiology, and kidney pathology. For support in evidence review, expertise in methods, and guideline development, the NKF contracted with the ERT based at the Tufts Center for Kidney Disease Guideline Development and Implementation at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. The ERT consisted of physician-methodologists with expertise in nephrology and internal medicine, and research associates and assistants. The ERT instructed and advised Work Group members in all steps of literature review, critical literature appraisal, and guideline development. The Work Group and the ERT collaborated closely throughout the project.</p>
<p><strong>Systematic Review: General Process</strong></p>
<p>The first task of the Work Group was to define the overall topics and goals for the guideline. The Work Group Co-Chairs drafted a preliminary list of topics. The Work Group identified the key clinical questions and triaged topics for systematic review and narrative review. The Work Group and ERT further developed and refined each systematic review topic, specified screening criteria, literature search strategies, and data extraction forms.</p>
<p>The ERT performed literature searches, and conducted abstract and article screening. The ERT also coordinated the methodological and analytic processes of the report. In addition, it defined and standardized the methodology in relation to these searches and data extraction, and produced summaries of the evidence. Throughout the project, the ERT offered suggestions for guideline development, led discussions on systematic review, literature searches, data extraction, assessment of quality and applicability of articles, evidence synthesis, grading of evidence and recommendations, and consensus development. With input from the Work Group, the ERT finalized eligible studies, performed all data extraction, and summarized data into summary tables. They also created preliminary evidence profiles, which were completed by the Work Group members. The Work Group members reviewed all included articles, data extraction forms, and summary tables for accuracy and completeness. The Work Group took the primary role of writing the recommendations and rationale statements, and retained final responsibility for the content of the recommendation statements and the accompanying narrative.</p>
<p>For questions of treatments in glomerulonephritis (GN), systematic reviews of the eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were undertaken (see Table 32 in the original guideline document). For these topics, the ERT created detailed data-extraction forms and extracted information on baseline data for the populations, interventions, study design, results, and provided an assessment of quality of study and outcomes. The ERT then tabulated studies in summary tables, and assigned grades for the quality of the evidence in consultation with the Work Group.</p>
<p><strong>Refinement of Topics</strong></p>
<p>At the first 3-day meeting, Work Group members added comments to the scope-of-work document as prepared by the Work Group Chairs and ERT, until the initial working document included all topics of interest to the Work Group. The inclusive, combined set of questions formed the basis for the deliberation and discussion that followed. The Work Group aimed to ensure that all topics deemed clinically relevant and worthy of review were identified and addressed. The major topic areas of interest for the care of GN included immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), lupus and vasculitis, minimal-change disease (MCD) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and membranous nephropathy (MN), membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), and infection.</p>
<p>At the initiation of the guideline development process, it was agreed that these guidelines would focus on patients who have GN. Thus, all topics, systematic reviews, and study eligibility criteria were restricted to patients with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of GN, with exceptions for diseases that do not require biopsy confirmation.</p>
<p>Based on the list of topics, the Work Group and ERT developed a list of specific research questions for which systematic review would be performed. For each systematic review topic, the Work Group Co-Chairs and the ERT formulated well-defined systematic review research questions using a well-established system. For each question, explicit criteria were agreed on for the population, intervention or predictor, comparator, outcomes of interest, and study design features. A list of outcomes of interest was generated.</p>
<p>The Work Group and the ERT agreed upon specific outcomes of interest: all-cause mortality, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), disease remission, relapse, proteinuria, kidney function, and adverse events. ESRD and mortality were ranked as being of critical importance. The Work Group ranked patient-centered clinical outcomes (such as death, ESRD, remission and categorical proteinuria and kidney function changes) as more important than intermediate outcomes (such as continuous outcomes of proteinuria and kidney function). Categorical outcomes are those that describe when a patient moves from one health state (e.g., macroalbuminuria) to another (e.g., no albuminuria). Continuous outcomes would be evaluations of the laboratory values alone (e.g., change in proteinuria in mg/dl). The outcomes were further categorized as being of critical, high, or moderate clinical importance to patients with GN. In general, eligibility criteria were determined based on clinical value, relevance to the guidelines and clinical practice, determination whether a set of studies would affect recommendations or the strength of evidence, and practical issues, such as available time and resources.</p>
<p><strong>Grading the Strength of the Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The strength of a recommendation is graded as Level 1 or Level 2. The 'Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations' field shows the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) nomenclature for grading the strength of a recommendation, and the implications of each level for patients, clinicians, and policy-makers. Recommendations can be for or against doing something. Table 40 in the original guideline document shows that the strength of a recommendation is determined not just by the quality of the evidence, but also by other&amp;mdash;often complex&amp;mdash;judgments regarding the size of the net medical benefit, values, and preferences, and costs. Formal decision analyses including cost analysis were not conducted.</p>
<p><strong>Ungraded Statements</strong></p>
<p>This category was designed to allow the Work Group to issue general advice. Typically an ungraded statement meets the following criteria: it provides guidance based on common sense; it provides reminders of the obvious; it is not sufficiently specific to allow application of evidence to the issue and, therefore, it is not based on systematic evidence review. Common examples include recommendations about frequency of testing, referral to specialists, and routine medical care. We strove to minimize the use of ungraded recommendations.</p>
<p>This grading scheme with two levels for the strength of a recommendation together with four levels of grading the quality of the evidence, and the option of an ungraded statement for general guidance, was adopted by the KDIGO Board in December 2008. The Work Group took the primary role of writing the recommendations and rationale statements, and retained final responsibility for the content of the guideline statements and the accompanying narrative. The evidence review team (ERT) reviewed draft recommendations and grades for consistency with the conclusions of the evidence review.</p></div>"/>

<p>Several tools and checklists have been developed to assess the quality of the methodological process for systematic review and guideline development. These include the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) criteria, the Conference on Guideline Standardization (COGS) checklist, and the Institute of Medicine's recent <em>Standards for Systematic Reviews</em> and <em>Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust</em>. Online Appendices 2 and 3 (see the 'Availability of Companion Documents' field) show the COGS criteria that correspond to the AGREE checklist and the Institute of Medicine standards, and how each one of them is addressed in this guideline.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The potential adverse effects of immunosuppressive therapy must always be discussed with the patient and family before treatment is initiated. The risks of treatment with many of the agents are significant and may have a substantial latent period (e.g., cyclophosphamide). A balance must be struck between the potential risks of immunosuppressive treatment for glomerulonephritis and the seriousness of the patient's condition. It is sometimes difficult to reconcile the immediate risks of immunosuppression, in the otherwise clinically well patient, vs. the potential for progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, given that advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD)&amp;mdash;and, particularly, ESRD&amp;mdash;is associated with a significant shortening of life expectancy even with dialysis or transplantation, the balancing of risks and benefits over time must be considered. The physician must be aware of this conundrum and where the evidence for treatment is weak (but potentially life-altering) and the risk for harm strong, a full disclosure is mandatory. Individual patient perceptions of the acceptability of any adverse effect may strongly influence the decision (e.g., the possibility of hirsutism with cyclosporine therapy may be perceived as less tolerable in a young female than in an older male). What might be seen as an acceptable trade-off by the physician may not be viewed similarly by the patient, leading to an issue over compliance with therapy. </li>
    <li>Limiting the long-term adverse effects of treatment is an important objective. Children with frequently relapsing (FR) or steroid-dependent steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SD SSNS) require prolonged corticosteroid therapy, which is associated with significant adverse effects, including impaired linear growth, behavioral changes, obesity, Cushing's syndrome, hypertension, ophthalmological disorders, impaired glucose tolerance, and reduced bone mineral density. Adverse effects may persist into adult life in young people, who continue to relapse after puberty. To reduce the risk of corticosteroid related adverse effects, children with FR or SD SSNS may require other agents, including alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil) and calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) (cyclosporine, tacrolimus). Adverse effects of these agents include increased risk of infection and reduced fertility (alkylating agents) and kidney dysfunction and hypertension (CNI). </li>
    <li>The principal side-effects of cyclosporine are kidney dysfunction, hypertension, gum hypertrophy, and hypertrichosis. Hypertension and kidney dysfunction are reported in 5%&amp;ndash;10% of children. Hypertrichosis and gum hypertrophy develop in 70% and 30%, respectively, in children treated with cyclosporine for more than 1 year. Tacrolimus also causes kidney dysfunction and hypertension, but significantly less hypertrichosis; tacrolimus-associated diabetes mellitus has been described in children with nephrotic syndrome. In children receiving cyclosporine for 12 months or more, tubulointerstitial lesions on kidney biopsy are reported in 30%&amp;ndash;40% of cases. This increases to 80% after 4 or more years of treatment. Cyclosporine-associated arteriopathy is uncommon. </li>
    <li>Rituximab caused acute reactions, such as fever, vomiting and diarrhea, skin rash, and bronchospasm in about one-third of patients in one series. Other reported serious side effects include <em>Pneumocystis jiroveci</em> pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis. </li>
    <li>Adverse effects of levamisole are uncommon and minor, with mild leucopenia and gastrointestinal upsets described. Rare cases of cutaneous vasculitis have been described with levamisole therapy. </li>
    <li>Adverse effects associated with cyclical corticosteroid/alkylating-agent regimen include: enhanced risk of opportunistic infection, reactivation of viral hepatitis, alopecia, gonadal damage (aspermatogenesis, ovulation failure), hemorrhagic cystitis (cyclophosphamide only), neoplasia, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myelogenous leukemia, transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, ureter or pelvis, and toxic hepatitis. </li>
    <li>The adverse effects of alkylating-cytotoxic agents are substantial, and include gonadal toxicity, bladder carcinoma, bone marrow hypoplasia, leukemogenesis, and serious opportunistic infections. </li>
    <li>Adverse events including serious infections and deaths have been associated with mycophenolate. </li>
    <li>Ribavirin dose needs to be titrated according to patient tolerance; caution is advised for patients with clearance &amp;lt;50 ml/min which may require substantially reduced dosage. </li>
    <li>Nephrotoxicity of some of the nucleoside analogues (adefovir and tenofovir) can be of concern. </li>
    <li>A study in 80 children with newly diagnosed immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) compared the effects of the combination of prednisolone, azathioprine, warfarin, and dipyridamole with those of prednisolone alone. Some side-effects were observed including leucopenia, glaucoma, and aseptic necrosis. </li>
    <li>Patients on hydroxychloroquine should have yearly eye examinations for retinal toxicity, especially after 5 years of continuous use. </li>
    <li>Continued maintenance therapy for Pauci-immune focal and segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis is associated with the risks of immunosuppression, bone marrow suppression (leucopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia), and possibly increased risk of cancer, notably skin cancer. </li>
