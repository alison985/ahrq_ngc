	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>General Assumptions</strong></p>
<p>The following assumptions clarified the interpretation of the clinical scenarios presented in the Treatment of Distal Radius Fractures Appropriate Use Criteria. This standardization ensures that those responsible for rating the appropriateness of a scenario and those reading these scenarios are using the same parameters to address the scenario.</p>
<p>Before these Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) are consulted, it is assumed that:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>The patient is healthy enough to undergo surgery if indicated. </li>
    <li>An adequate physical exam of the patient has been conducted. </li>
    <li>Adequate radiographs have been obtained and examined by the clinician. </li>
    <li>The patient history is available and has been reviewed by the clinician. </li>
    <li>The patient has given adequate and informed consent. </li>
    <li>The surgeon is trained and capable of performing all operative techniques with equal effectiveness. </li>
    <li>The fracture is not so complex, and/or the patient's comorbidities or social situation such a factor, as to represent an exception to these scenarios (e.g., C3.3 fracture that might be optimally treated with a distraction plate). </li>
    <li>There is not a clear advantage (i.e., evidence for or against) for one procedure based on fracture pattern (e.g., volar plate for volar shearing fracture). </li>
    <li>The surgery, when indicated, will be performed in a timely fashion to allow ideal treatment of the fracture. </li>
    <li>The surgeon will perform the surgery in the most appropriate location (i.e., ambulatory surgical center [ASC], outpatient, inpatient) based on the health of the patient and other injuries rather the nature of the fracture. Open fractures and associated injuries may dictate that surgery should be inpatient. </li>
    <li>The surgeon will choose a cost-effective treatment based on the nature of the fracture and expectations after surgery. </li>
    <li>The facility has each type of implant/equipment available and capable support personnel. </li>
    <li>In the event that the patient has an open wound, it is assumed that the clinician has cleaned the wound before considering treatment. </li>
    <li>It is assumed that a low-energy open fracture is a Grade I or II open fracture. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Results of Appropriateness Ratings</strong></p>
<p>The appropriate use criteria tables (see pp. 18-23 of the original guideline document) contain the final appropriateness ratings assigned by the nine members of the voting panel. The appropriate use criteria tables are formatted by AO (Arbeitsgemeinschaft f&amp;uuml;r Osteosynthesefragen [Association for the Study of Internal Fixation]) fracture type (i.e., A, B, or C) and mechanism of injury (i.e., high mechanism of injury versus low mechanism of injury). Additional patient characteristics are found under the column titled &quot;Patient Characteristics&quot;. The appropriate use criteria for each patient scenario can be found under each of the 10 treatment columns. These criteria are formatted by appropriateness labels (i.e., &quot;R&quot;=Rarely Appropriate, &quot;M&quot;=May Be Appropriate, and &quot;A&quot;=Appropriate), median score (in parentheses), and + or - indicating agreement or disagreement, respectively.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Concurrent with the Writing Panel developing the criteria, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) Unit undertook a literature review based on the results of the AAOS clinical practice guideline and all literature published after the release of the clinical practice guideline related to the treatment of distal radius fractures. This literature review informed the decisions relevant to the indications identified by the Writing Panel when they were available and necessary. The literature review also considered lower quality evidence when the best available evidence (i.e., randomized control trials) did not contain information relevant to the clinical scenarios. The full results of the literature review appear in the Literature Review Findings section of the original guideline document.</p>
<p>PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched. The literature search for the AUC was an update of the 2009 &quot;Treatment of Distal Radius Fractures&quot; clinical practice guideline literature search and was conducted from June of 2011 to February of 2012. The updated search covered articles published from January 1966 to February 1, 2012.</p>
<p>All articles were appraised for study quality and applicability. Those studies with extremely poor designs, as defined by the AAOS's appraisal method, were not included in the literature review.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Developing Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Members of the Treatment of Distal Radius Fractures Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) Writing Panel, who are orthopaedic specialists in treatment of distal radius fractures, developed clinical scenarios using the following guidelines:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Include a broad spectrum of patients that may be eligible for treatment of distal radius fractures <em>(comprehensive)</em> </li>
    <li>Classify patients into a unique scenario <em>(mutually exclusive)</em> </li>
    <li>Consistently classify similar patients into the same scenario <em>(reliable, valid indicators)</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>The Writing Panel developed the scenarios by categorizing patients in terms of indications evident during the clinical decision making process (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document). These scenarios relied upon definitions and general assumptions, mutually agreed upon by the Writing Panel during the development of the scenarios. These definitions and assumptions were necessary to provide consistency in the interpretation of the clinical scenarios among experts voting on the scenarios and readers using the final criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Formulating Indications and Scenarios</strong></p>
<p>The scenarios began development with the Treatment of Distal Radius Fractures AUC Writing Panel identifying clinical indications typical of patients commonly presenting for treatment of distal radius fractures in clinical practice. Indications are most often parameters observable by the clinician, including symptoms or results of diagnostic tests. Additionally &quot;human factor&quot; (e.g., activity level) or demographic variables can be considered.</p>
<p>Indications identified in clinical trials (derived from patient selection criteria) included in the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Clinical Practice Guidelines served as a starting point for the Treatment of Distal Radius Fractures AUC Writing Panel and ensured that these Appropriate Use Criteria referred to the evidence base for the Treatment of Distal Radius Fractures AUC. The Writing Panel considered this initial list and other indications based on their clinical expertise and selected the most clinically relevant indications. The Writing Panel then defined distinct classes for each indication in order to stratify/categorize the indication (see Table 1 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>The Writing Panel organized these indications into a matrix of clinical scenarios (see Appendix B in the original guideline document) that addressed all combinations of the classifications. The Writing Panel was given the opportunity to remove any scenarios that never occur in clinical practice; however, they agreed that all 240 scenarios could present themselves in clinical practice, thus no scenarios were removed. The major clinical decision making indications chosen by the Writing Panel divided the matrix of clinical scenarios into chapters. AO (Arbeitsgemeinschaft f&amp;uuml;r Osteosynthesefragen [Association for the Study of Internal Fixation]) fracture type, mechanism of injury, functional demands, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status, and associated injuries served as the major clinical decision making indications for the chapters presented in Table 1 of the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Creating Definitions and Assumptions</strong></p>
<p>The Treatment of Distal Radius Fractures AUC Writing Panel constructed concise and explicit definitions for the indications and classifications. This standardization helped ensure that how the Writing Panel defined AO fracture types, mechanisms of injury, functional demands, ASA statuses, and associated injuries was consistent among those reading the clinical scenario matrix or the final criteria. Definitions drew explicit boundaries when possible and were based on standard medical practice or existing literature.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Writing Panel formulated a list of general assumptions in order to provide more consistent interpretations of a scenario. These assumptions differed from definitions in that they identified circumstances that exist outside of the control of the clinical decision making process. The main goal of assumptions was to focus scenarios so that they apply to the average patient presenting to an average physician at an average facility.</p>
<p>The definitions and assumptions provided all readers with a common starting point in interpreting the clinical scenarios. This list of definitions and assumptions accompanied the matrix of clinical scenarios in all stages of the development of this AUC and appears in the Definitions and Assumptions section of the original guideline document (see also the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong>Voting Panel Modifications to Writing Panel Materials</strong></p>
<p>The original indications table constructed by the Writing Panel was modified by the Voting Panel during the round two discussions. See the &quot;Methodology&quot; section in the original guideline document for additional details of Voting Panel modifications.</p>
<p><strong>Literature Review</strong></p>
<p>Concurrent with the Writing Panel developing the criteria, the AAOS Appropriate Use Criteria Unit undertook a literature review based on the results of the AAOS clinical practice guideline and all literature published after the release of the clinical practice guideline related to the treatment of distal radius fractures. This literature review informed the decisions relevant to the indications identified by the Writing Panel when they were available and necessary. The literature review also considered lower quality evidence when the best available evidence (i.e., randomized control trials) did not contain information relevant to the clinical scenarios. The full results of the literature review appear in the &quot;Literature Review Findings&quot; section of the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Reviewing Scenarios</strong></p>
<p>After the Writing Panel developed the scenarios, the Treatment of Distal Radius Fractures AUC Review Panel reviewed the proposed chapters in order to ensure that they were representative of patients and scenarios clinicians are likely to encounter. The Review Panel was comprised of orthopaedic surgeons who routinely perform treatments for distal radius fractures and other specialties who may refer patients with distal radius fractures to a specialist. No member of this panel participated in the Writing Panel&amp;rsquo;s initial development of the scenarios or participated in the appropriateness rating of the scenarios.</p>
<p>Review Panel members considered the lists of scenarios, definitions, assumptions and the literature review associated with each scenario. Each independent reviewer suggested to the Writing Panel, potential modifications to the content or structure of the lists and literature review. The Writing Panel provided final determination of modifications to the indications, scenarios, assumptions and literature review.</p>
<p><strong>Determining Appropriateness</strong></p>
<p><em>Treatment of Distal Radius Fractures AUC Voting Panel</em></p>
<p>A multidisciplinary panel of clinicians assembled to determine the appropriateness of treatments for distal radius fractures. This group consisted of approximately 50% specialists and 50% generalists. Two non-voting moderators who are orthopaedic surgeons but are not specialists in treatment of distal radius fractures facilitated the Voting Panel. The moderators were familiar with the methods and procedures of AAOS Appropriate Use Criteria and led the panel (as non-voters) in discussions. Additionally, no member of the voting panel was involved in the development (Writing Panel) or independent review (Review Panel) of the scenarios.</p>
<p>The Voting Panel used a modified Delphi procedure to determine appropriateness ratings. The Voting Panel participated in two rounds of voting while considering evidence-based information provided in the literature review. While cost is often a relevant consideration, panelists focused their appropriateness ratings on the effectiveness of treatment for distal radius fractures.</p>
<p><em>Rating Appropriateness</em></p>
<p>When rating the appropriateness of a scenario, the Voting Panel considered the following definition:</p>
<p>&quot;An appropriate treatment for distal radius fractures is one for which the treatment is generally acceptable, is a reasonable approach for the indication, and is likely to improve the patient's health outcomes or survival.&quot;</p>
<p>They then rated each scenario <strong>using their best clinical judgment, taking into consideration the available evidence, for an average patient presenting to an average physician at an average facility</strong> as follows:</p>

<p>Each panelist uses the scale below to record their response for each scenario:</p>

    <li>May Be Appropriate: 4, 5, 6 </li>
    <li>Appropriate: 7, 8, 9 </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Round One Voting</em></p>
<p>The first round of voting occurred after completion of the independent review of the scenarios by the Review Panel and approval of the final indications, scenarios, and assumptions by the Writing Panel. The Voting Panel rated the scenarios electronically using a personalized ballot created by AAOS staff using SNAP 10 Survey Software. There was no interaction between panel members while completing the first round of voting. Panelists considered the following materials:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The instructions for rating appropriateness </li>
    <li>The completed literature review, that is appropriately referenced when evidence is available for a scenario </li>
    <li>The list of indications, definitions and assumptions, to ensure consistency in the interpretation of the clinical scenarios </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Round Two Voting</em></p>
<p>The second round of voting occurred after a series of 3 conference calls, which were led by a non-voting moderator. Before the discussions, each panelist received a personalized document that included their first round ratings along with summarized results of the first-round ratings that resulted in disagreement. These results indicated the frequency of ratings for a scenario for all panelists. The document contained no identifying information for other panelists' ratings. The moderator also used a document that summarized the results of the panelists first round voting. These personalized documents served as the basis for discussions of scenarios which resulted in disagreement.</p>
<p>After all of the disagreed upon scenarios were discussed, the Voting Panel performed a second round of voting for only those scenarios. After the round two ratings were submitted, AAOS staff calculated the median values and level of agreement for all voting items, after which the Voting Panel examined the ratings for anomalies. There was no attempt to obtain consensus among the panel members.</p>
<p><em>Final Ratings</em></p>
<p>Using the median value of the second round ratings, AAOS determined the final levels of appropriateness. Disagreement among raters can affect the final rating. Agreement and disagreement were determined using the BIOMED definitions of Agreement and Disagreement as reported in the Research and Development/University of California, Los Angeles (RAND/UCLA) Appropriate Method User's Manual for a panel of 8 to 10 voting members (see Table 3 in the original guideline document). For this panel size, disagreement is defined as when &amp;ge; 3 member's appropriateness ratings fell within the appropriate (7-9) and rarely appropriate (1-3) ranges for any scenario (i.e., &amp;ge;3 member's ratings fell between 1-3 and &amp;ge;3 member's ratings fell between 7-9 on any given scenario and its treatment). If there is still disagreement in the Voting Panel ratings after the second round of voting, that voting item is labeled as &quot;5&quot; regardless of median score. Agreement is defined as &amp;le;2 panelists rated outside of the 3-point range containing the median.</p>

    <li>Volunteer physicians from multiple medical specialties created and categorized these Appropriate Use Criteria. These Appropriate Use Criteria are not intended to be comprehensive or a fixed protocol, as some patients may require more or less treatment or different means of diagnosis. These Appropriate Use Criteria represent patients and situations that clinicians treating or diagnosing musculoskeletal conditions are most likely to encounter. The clinician's independent medical judgment, given the individual patient's clinical circumstances, should always determine patient care and treatment. </li>
    <li>These criteria should not be construed as including all indications or excluding indications reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. The criteria intend to address the most common clinical scenarios facing all appropriately trained surgeons and all qualified physicians managing patients under consideration for treatment of distal radius fractures. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific criteria should address all circumstances presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution. It is also important to state that these criteria were developed as guidelines and are not meant to supersede clinician expertise and experience or patient preference. </li>
    <li>Some drugs or medical devices referenced or described in this document may not have been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or may have been cleared for a specific use only. The FDA has stated that it is the responsibility of the physician to determine the FDA clearance status of each drug or device he or she wishes to use in clinical practice. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Disseminating Appropriate Use Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Publication of the Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) document is on the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Web site at <a href=&quot;http://www.aaos.org/auc&quot; title=&quot;American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Web site&quot;>http://www.aaos.org/auc</a>. This document provides interested readers with full documentation about the development of Appropriate Use Criteria and further details of the criteria ratings.</p>
<p>AUCs are first announced by an Academy press release and then published on the AAOS Web site. AUC summaries are published in the AAOS <em>Now</em> and the <em>Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons</em> (JAAOS). In addition, the Academy's Annual Meeting showcases the AUCs on Academy Row and at Scientific Exhibits.</p>
<p>The dissemination efforts of AUC include web-based mobile applications, webinars, online modules for the Orthopaedic Knowledge Online Web site, Radio Media Tours, and Media Briefings. In addition AUCs are also promoted in relevant Continuing Medical Education (CME) courses and distributed at the AAOS Resource Center.</p>
<p>Other dissemination efforts outside of the AAOS include submitting AUCs to the National Guideline Clearinghouse and to other medical specialty societies' meetings.</p></div>"/>
