S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a public health advisory to notify health care professionals and consumers that the sponsor of Palladone, Purdue Pharma, has agreed to suspend sales and marketing of Palladone (hydromorphone hydrochloride, extended release capsules), a potent narcotic painkiller, because of the potential for severe side effects if Palladone is taken with alcohol. Drinking alcohol while taking Palladone may cause rapid release of hydromorphone, leading to high drug levels in the body, with potentially fatal effects. High drug levels of hydromorphone may depress or stop breathing, cause coma, and even cause death. </li>

<p><strong>Initial Steps of Opioid Therapy</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Comprehensive assessment and documentation is recommended before initiating opioid therapy, including documentation of comprehensive history, general medical condition, psychosocial history, psychiatric status, and substance use history. (<strong>Evidence: good</strong>) </li>
    <li>Despite limited evidence for reliability and accuracy, screening for opioid use is recommended, as it will identify opioid abusers and reduce opioid abuse. (<strong>Evidence: limited</strong>) </li>
    <li>Prescription monitoring programs must be implemented due to regulations, as they provide data on patterns of prescription usage, reduce prescription drug abuse or doctor shopping, and prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) may reduce emergency room visits, drug overdoses, or deaths. (<strong>Evidence: good to fair</strong>) </li>
    <li>Urine drug testing (UDT) must be implemented from initiation along with subsequent adherence monitoring, in an in office setting with immunoassay and confirmation for accuracy with chromatography in select cases, to identify patients who are non-compliant or abusing prescription drugs or illicit drugs, and urine drug testing may decrease prescription drug abuse or illicit drug use when patients are in chronic pain management therapy. (<strong>Evidence: good</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Establishing Diagnosis</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Establish appropriate physical diagnosis and psychological diagnosis if available prior to initiating opioid therapy. (<strong>Evidence: good</strong>) </li>
    <li>Caution must be exercised in ordering various imaging and other evaluations, and only appropriate information in the realm of clinical relevance shall be provided by the treating physician to the patients when there is correlation of the symptoms with findings; to avoid increased fear, activity restriction, requests for increased opioids, and maladaptive behaviors. (<strong>Evidence: good</strong>) </li>
    <li>A pain management consultation, for non-pain physicians, if high-dose opioid therapy is being utilized. (<strong>Evidence: fair</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Establishing Medical Necessity</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>It is essential to establish medical necessity prior to initiation or maintenance of opioid therapy. (<strong>Evidence: good</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Establishing Treatment Goals</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>It is essential to establish treatment goals of opioid therapy with regard to pain relief and improvement in function. (<strong>Evidence: good</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Assessment of Effectiveness of Opioid Therapy</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Clinicians must understand the effectiveness and adverse consequences of long-term opioid therapy in chronic non-cancer pain and its limitations. (<strong>Evidence: fair for short-term, limited for long-term</strong>) </li>
    <li>The long-acting opioids in high doses are recommended only in specific circumstances with severe intractable pain that is not amenable to short-acting or moderate doses of long-acting opioids, as there is no significant difference between long-acting and short-acting opioids for their effectiveness or adverse effects. (<strong>Evidence: fair</strong>) </li>
    <li>A trial of opioid rotation may be considered for patients requiring escalating doses. (<strong>Evidence: limited</strong>) </li>
    <li>It is recommended that contraindications to opioid use in chronic non-cancer pain must be evaluated including respiratory instability, acute psychiatric instability, uncontrolled suicide risk, active or history of alcohol or substance abuse, confirmed allergy to opioid agents, coadministration of drugs capable of inducing life-limiting drug interaction, concomitant use of benzodiazepines, active diversion of controlled substances, and concomitant use of heavy doses of central nervous system depressants, such as benzodiazepines. (<strong>Evidence: fair to limited</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Informed Decision-Making</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>A robust agreement which is followed by all parties is essential in initiating and maintaining opioid therapy, as such agreements reduce overuse, misuse, abuse, and diversion. (<strong>Evidence: fair</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Initial Treatment</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Once medical necessity is established, opioid therapy may be initiated with low doses and short-acting drugs with appropriate monitoring to provide effective relief and avoid side effects. (<strong>Evidence: fair for short-term effectiveness, limited for long-term effectiveness</strong>) </li>
    <li>Up to 40 mg of morphine equivalent doses are being recommended as low dose, 41 to 90 mg of morphine equivalent dose as a moderate dose, and greater than 91 mg of morphine equivalence as high doses. (<strong>Evidence: fair</strong>) </li>
    <li>In reference to long-acting opioids, titration must be carried out with caution and overdose and misuse must be avoided. (<strong>Evidence: good</strong>) </li>
    <li>Methadone is recommended for use in late stages after failure of other opioid therapy and only by clinicians with specific training in the risks and uses. (<strong>Evidence: limited</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Adherence Monitoring</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Monitoring recommendation for methadone prescription is that an electrocardiogram should be obtained prior to initiation, at 30 days and yearly thereafter. (<strong>Evidence: fair</strong>) </li>
    <li>In order to reduce prescription drug abuse and doctor shopping, adherence monitoring by urine drug testing and PMDPs provide evidence that is essential to the identification of those patients who are non-compliant or abusing prescription drugs or illicit drugs. (<strong>Evidence: fair</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Monitoring and Managing Side Effects</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>It is essential to monitor for side effects and manage them appropriately including discontinuation of opioids if indicated. (<strong>Evidence: fair</strong>) </li>
    <li>Constipation must be closely monitored and a bowel regimen be initiated as soon as deemed necessary. (<strong>Evidence: good</strong>) </li>
    <li>It is recommended that a policy of driving under the influence of drugs be developed and monitored during initiation of therapy, changes in the dosages, and addition of other centrally acting agents. (<strong>Evidence: good</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Final Phase</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Chronic opioid therapy may be continued, with continuous adherence monitoring, modified at any time during this phase, with fair evidence showing effectiveness of opioids in well-selected populations, in conjunction with or after failure of other modalities of treatments with improvement in physical and functional status and minimal adverse effects. (<strong>Evidence: fair</strong>) </li>
    <li>Methadone is recommended for use in late stages after failure of other opioid therapy and only by clinicians with specific training in the risks and uses. (<strong>Evidence: limited</strong>) </li>
    <li>A trial of opioid rotation may be considered for patients requiring escalating doses. (<strong>Evidence: limited</strong>) </li>
    <li>Chronic opioid therapy should be monitored for adverse effects and to manage them appropriately. (<strong>Evidence: good</strong>) </li>

<p>American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) convened a multidisciplinary panel of 56 experts in various fields to review the evidence and formulate recommendations for chronic opioid therapy in non-cancer pain. The panel has been instructed to answer questions and develop evidence pertaining to important aspects of opioid therapy. Members of the panel were also requested to develop comprehensive reviews on various related subjects in preparation for the opioid guidelines. Other independent submissions were also considered. The panel members convened in person on 3 occasions in Memphis, Tennessee, during other workshops conducted by ASIPP, and also had 5 webinars and/or telephone conferences. The majority of the participants attended multiple meetings.</p>
<p>The committee provided a broad representation of academic and non-academic clinical practitioners, representing a variety of practices and geographic areas, all with interest and expertise in opioid use and management of patients with chronic non-cancer pain. The committee formulized the elements of the guidelines preparation process, including literature searches, literature synthesis, consensus evaluation, open forum presentations, and formal endorsement by the ASIPP Board of Directors and peer review.</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Development Process</strong></p>
<p>The guidelines panel met on multiple occasions. At the first meeting, the panel defined the scope and development of recommendations for important aspects to guide the systematic evidence review and synthesis. During the course of multiple meetings the sub-panels reviewed the results of the evidence review and drafted potential recommendations. The final consensus was carried out by electronic communication with further discussions, revisions, and final recommendations approved by at least two-thirds of the majority.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Multiple side effects of opioids, including effect on driving, sedation, constipation, and breathing specifically in patients with respiratory disorders, must be monitored. </li>
    <li>Adverse effects have been commonly reported with nausea in 28%, constipation in 26%, somnolence/drowsiness in 24%, dizziness/vertigo in 18%, dry-skin/itching in 15%, and vomiting in 15% of patients on relatively high-dose opioids. Low-dose opioids, however, have been accompanied by lesser complications. The majority of these adverse effects are resolved with continued treatment and dose adjustments. However, constipation may not be resolved and requires a bowel regimen. Furthermore, with long-term therapy and high doses, other complications may be noted including hypogonadism, neuroendocrine dysfunction, sleep disorders, and hyperalgesia. Other effects which are seen in less than 10% of the population include dry mouth, headache, sexual dysfunction, hot flashes, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, fatigue, sleeplessness/insomnia, sweating, blurred vision/confusion, muscle contractions, diarrhea, ataxia, edema, difficulty urinating, restless legs, application site reaction, heartburn, anxiety, and weakness. The majority of these complications do resolve except for sexual dysfunction and fatigue, which increase with long-term treatment with hormonal imbalances. However, the complications are more frequent, longer lasting, and severe in long-term high-dose opioid therapy. Peripheral edema, though observed in a small proportion of patients, could be a major issue. Neuroendocrine abnormalities with erectile dysfunction must be taken into consideration and explained to the patient, with appropriate referral when indicated. Similarly sleep apnea and opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) must be handled appropriately. Refer to section 9.0, Monitoring and Managing Side Effects, in the original guideline document for additional information. </li>
    <li>The development of tolerance, dependency, addiction, and hyperalgesia are a major concern. </li>
    <li>Acetaminophen toxicity causes the majority of cases of acute renal failure in the United States. Sub-clinical liver toxicity has been shown to occur with doses below 4 grams per day. Alcohol also competes for the same metabolic pathway as acetaminophen placing heavy drinkers at higher risk for toxicity. Chronic alcohol use is an independent risk factor for mortality in acetaminophen poisoning. </li>
    <li>Morphine can cause toxicity in patients with renal dysfunction. It has been shown that M-6 glucuronide, an active metabolite of morphine, accumulates in the serum of patients and causes central nervous system and respiratory depression. The degree of accumulation was related to the morphine dose and the extent of renal impairment. </li>
    <li>Fentanyl, 80-100 times as potent as morphine, can cause significant central nervous system and respiratory depression and also has been shown to contribute to numerous overdose deaths. </li>
    <li>When switching from codeine to fentanyl, regardless of the codeine dose, caution must be exercised as patients may have little or no opioid tolerance. </li>
    <li>In reference to methadone, even though it has not been shown to be more effective than other opioids, it has been used extensively in the United States and associated with multiple adverse consequences including prolonged QT interval. Methadone has been associated with numerous overdose deaths in pain patients with analgesic use increasing sharply in the United States, with a 1,293% increase from 1997 to 2007. </li>
    <li>Combinations of short- and long-acting, and high doses of long-acting opioids must be prescribed with extreme caution. </li>

    <li>These guidelines are developed for use by physicians practicing interventional pain management and do not constitute inflexible treatment recommendations. The guidelines may, however, also be applied to other physicians, as well as practitioners involved in prescribing opioids. These guidelines are not intended to address all possible clinical situations where opioids might be used for non-cancer pain in clinical practices. It is expected that a provider will establish a plan of care on a case-by-case basis, with consideration of individual patients' medical conditions, personal needs, and preferences, as well as the physician's experience. Based on individual patients' needs, a treatment different from the guidance provided and outlined here could be warranted. Thus, these guidelines do not represent the &quot;standard of care.&quot; </li>
    <li>The focus of these guidelines is to curtail the abuse of opioids without jeopardizing non-cancer pain management. It is recognized that the management of non-cancer pain takes place in a wide context of health care situations, involving multiple specialties and multiple techniques. However, providers managing acute pain must be cognizant of the fact that once opioid use commences, they are continued in the majority of patients in the chronic phase and throughout their lifetime frequently. Consequently, these guidelines cannot be applied to all patients. The decision to implement a particular management approach should be based on a comprehensive assessment of the patient's overall health status, disease state, preference, and physician training and skill. </li>
