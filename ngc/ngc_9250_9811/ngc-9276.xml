    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
        <li>Prior to treatment, assess causative and contributing factors and significant signs and symptoms to differentiate the different types of lower-extremity ulcers that require varying treatments (see Algorithm in Appendix A in original guideline document). </li>
        <li>Review health history to address risk factors for LEVD (i.e., family history, pregnancy, older age, thrombophilia, systemic inflammation, obesity, venous thromboembolism [VTE], triggers), wound and pain history, and history of prescribed/self-prescribed medications. <strong>Level of Evidence = C</strong>
        <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
            <li>Assess pain characteristics: onset, duration, location, precipitating/alleviating factors and presence/absence of venous claudication or rest pain (found in mixed disease). Note: Pain may be variable in LEVD: mild to severe, stinging, throbbing and accompanied by complaints of heaviness worsening with prolonged leg dependency. </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;3&quot;>
        <li>Review pertinent labs:
        <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
            <li>Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and prothrombin time. </li>
            <li>If patient on warfarin (Coumadin) review international normalized ratios (INRs). <strong>Level of Evidence = C</strong> </li>
            <li>Elevated homocysteine (Hcy) levels (hyperhomocysteinemia). <strong>Level of Evidence = C</strong> </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;4&quot;>
        <li>Conduct a physical examination of the lower extremities.
        <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
            <li>Assess functional ability. </li>
            <li>Determine perfusion status by assessing skin temperature, capillary refill, venous refill, color changes and presence of paresthesias. </li>
            <li>Determine presence or absence of pedal pulses. Palpate both dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses of each lower extremity. Presence of palpable pulses does not rule out lower extremity arterial disease nor does absence of pulses indicate arterial disease, especially in presence of edema. <strong>Level of Evidence = C</strong> </li>
            <li>Perform an ankle brachial index (ABI) on all patients with leg ulcers. Recheck the ABI periodically (every 3 months) for patients with non-healing lower extremity ulcers. <strong>Level of Evidence = C</strong> </li>
            <li>Assess the lower extremity skin changes for edema, hemosiderin staining, venous dermatitis, atrophie blanche, varicose veins, ankle flaring, scarring from previous ulcers, lipodermatosclerosis, and elevated temperature. (See Appendix C in original guideline document on types of edema.) </li>
            <li>Assess for ulcer complications: cellulitis, gangrene, and osteomyelitis. </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;5&quot;>
        <li>Determine and document typical wound characteristics: location, shape, wound edges, wound bed, exudate, periwound skin, absence/presence of odor, and bleeding. </li>
        <li>Consider use of Duplex scanning with ultrasound, as it is the most reliable non-invasive test to diagnose anatomical and hemodynamic abnormalities and to detect reflux in any venous segment. <strong>Level of Evidence=A</strong> </li>
        <li>Monitor/measure the percentage change in ulcer area to assess healing. An ulcer that does not heal or show significant healing within 4 weeks should prompt the health care provider to consider adjunctive therapies. <strong>Level of Evidence = B </strong></li>
        <li>Assess for factors that impede healing such as co-morbid conditions, lack of adherence to prevention and treatment programs, especially compression therapy, and medications such as steroids. </li>
        <li>Consider referral for further evaluation of patients with cellulitis, VTE, variceal bleeds, and ulcers that are atypical in appearance or unresponsive to 2-4 weeks of appropriate therapies. </li>
        <li>Consider adjunctive therapies for slow to heal ulcers. <strong>Level of Evidence = A</strong> </li>

    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;11&quot;>
        <li>Encourage patients to undertake a program of physical activity to strengthen the calf muscle and increase ankle range of motion to prevent ulcer recurrence. <strong>Level of Evidence = A</strong> </li>
        <li>Educate patients that compression stockings or other compression wraps/bandages must be worn every day for the prevention of venous edema and venous leg ulcer recurrence. <strong>Level of Evidence = A </strong></li>
        <li>Screen all patients with lower extremity wounds for arterial disease using Doppler measurement of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) by suitably trained staff prior to application of compression stockings/bandages/wraps. </li>
        <li>Educate individuals with normal arterial blood flow to use the strongest compression (e.g., 40-50 mm Hg) that can be applied or tolerated. Lower compression may be helpful for individuals with LEVD and lipodermatosclerosis, who are unable to apply the compression garments, tolerate higher compression, or afford the cost of higher compression garments. <strong>Level of Evidence = B</strong> </li>
        <li>Have compression stockings fitted by trained personnel. </li>
        <li>Have compression bandages and wraps applied by skilled personnel. </li>
        <li>Wound care specialists should closely supervise and monitor compression for individuals with mixed venous/arterial insufficiency with an ABI &amp;gt;0.5 to &amp;lt;0.8. Do not apply sustained, high levels of compression for individuals with an ABI &amp;lt;0.5. </li>
        <li>Consider vein surgery to prevent ulcer recurrence. <strong>Level of Evidence = B</strong> </li>
        <li>Provide patient education about the necessity of wearing of compression stockings for the rest of one's life, elevating legs, managing weight, participating in physical activities, avoiding trauma, seeking early intervention for first signs of swelling, redness, or abnormal sensations in the skin, and discussing medication options should be stressed by health care providers. </li>

<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: upper-alpha;&quot; start=&quot;3&quot;>
    <li><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Interventions for Patients with LEVD and Ulcers</span></strong>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;20&quot;>
        <li>Recommend patients with LEVD and ulcers seek care guided by a clinical wound expert. <strong>Level of Evidence = C</strong> </li>
        <li>Cleanse the ulcer at each dressing change while minimizing trauma to the ulcer and surrounding skin. No specific studies demonstrate the benefit of using one cleanser over another, thus, ulcers should be cleansed with non-cytotoxic cleansers, saline, or water. <strong>Level of Evidence = C</strong> </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Dermatitis </strong></p>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;22&quot;>
        <li>Avoid the use of known skin irritants and allergens on the skin especially in patients with venous dermatitis because a high percentage of individuals with LEVD and ulcers experience hypersensitivity to various ingredients and products. </li>
        <li>Patch test individuals with known sensitivities or delayed wound healing prior to use of new products. Use a topical steroid ointment for patients with dermatitis for no longer than 2 weeks to reduce inflammation and itching. In severe cases, a prolonged trial might be warranted. </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Debridement</strong></p>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;24&quot;>
        <li>Closely monitor the ulcer when any debridement method is used such as autolysis or enzymatic debriding agents. No one method of debridement has been shown to be optimal for LEVD ulcers. </li>
        <li>Consider larval (maggot) therapy to remove necrotic tissue. <strong>Level of Evidence = B</strong> </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Pain Management</strong></p>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;26&quot;>
        <li>Consider topical anesthetic agents to provide pain relief for venous ulcer debridement such as eutectic mixture of local anesthetics (EMLA) and lidocaine-prilocaine based creams which have been found to reduce pain scores when used during debridement. <strong>Level of Evidence = B</strong> </li>
        <li>Consider use of hydrocolloid or foam dressings to reduce pain associated with LEVD ulcers. <strong>Level of Evidence = B</strong> </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Dressings</strong></p>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;28&quot;>
        <li>Select dressings according to accepted wound care principles, ulcer characteristics, patient needs such as comfort, cost, ease of application, wound draining absorption capability, and availability of dressings. </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Antibiotics</strong></p>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;29&quot;>
        <li>Treat deep tissue infection and cellulitis with systemic treatment approaches. Consider topical antimicrobial/antibiotics for superficial infection. Use culture guided antibiotic therapy. Consider a trial of using nontoxic antimicrobials (e.g., cadexomer iodine or silver dressings) for clinical infection as an alternative to topical antibiotics. <strong>Level of Evidence = C</strong> </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Nutrition</strong></p>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;30&quot;>
        <li>Consider use of Mesoglycan combined with usual care (compression, leg elevation) to promote ulcer healing. <strong>Level of Evidence = B</strong> </li>
        <li>Consider using Rutosides in doses ranging from 250 to 300 mg twice daily to improve ulcer healing rates. <strong>Level of Evidence = A</strong> </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Compression Therapy</strong></p>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;32&quot;>
        <li>Select compression methods based on careful assessment of the patient. </li>
        <li>Compression therapy heals more venous leg ulcers and decreases healing time compared to no compression therapy. <strong>Level of Evidence = A</strong> </li>
        <li>Use of high compression to treat patients with LEVD is reported to be more effective than low compression. There are no differences in the effectiveness of the different types of products available for high compression. However, there is some suggestion that elastic layers might be more beneficial. <strong>Level of Evidence = A</strong> </li>
        <li>Do not rely on antiembolism stockings or hose (15-17 mm Hg), which are not designed for therapeutic compression and should not be used as such. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The Wound, Ostomy, and Continence Nurses Society (WOCN) developed this evidence-based guideline using the following process. A panel of WOCN members, representing a wide range of experience and clinical practice backgrounds, convened to plan the guideline format. A topical outline was designed, and specific questions were proposed to provide focus for the evidence search. The review included studies reporting primary data relevant to lower-extremity venous disease (LEVD) and specific therapies or diagnostic modalities. The panel developed a list of 18 questions to guide the evidence-based literature review (see the original guideline document).</p>
<p>Summaries of the studies were presented to all task force members for review, discussion, and clarification. After a series of conference calls and meetings conducted September through February 2011, the guideline was finalized incorporating evidence from the studies. Studies supporting the guideline are cited in the text and listed in the references. To classify the strength of the evidence in this guideline, a level-of-evidence rating (Level A, B, or C) has been assigned to specific recommendations (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field). The rating refers to the strength of the evidence for a recommendation and does not relate to the importance of the recommendation. The rating system was adapted from the rating systems described by Sackett (1989), Cook, Guyatt, Laupacis, and Sackett (1994), and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR&amp;mdash;now called AHRQ; 1992, 1994).

    <li>A review of ingredients and products that cause positive patch test results in individuals with venous ulcers show that between 46% and 67% of individuals have positive patch tests with a high incidence of hypersensitivity to lanolin and topical antibiotics. Also implicated are Balsam of Peru (one of the most common sensitizers), bacitracin, corticosteroid ointments, neomycin sulfate, chloramphenicol, nickel sulfate, silver nitrate, propylene glycol, certain hydrocolloid formulations, parabens (bepanthen), benzalkonium chloride, povidone iodine, colophony (used as an adhesive and as a stimulant in ointments), rubber-related allergens, ester gum resin, and fragrance mix. </li>
    <li>Patch testing to standard and special series allergens should be performed in cases of prolonged leg ulcer healing. Clinicians should be aware that multiple reactions in the same patient are common. Of note, sensitivity to lanolin products is decreasing world-wide; however, there are reports of increasing sensitivity to new products containing certain hydrogels that form the basis of sustained-release topical drug delivery systems. </li>
    <li>Leg wounds treated with topical antibiotics may develop resistant organisms or sensitivities over time. </li>
    <li>In patients with mixed arterial/venous disease where compression is used, close supervision, monitoring, and strict attention to correct bandaging is required by a wound care specialist. Patients should be instructed about the risks associated with compression, such as uncomfortable tightening of the bandage after application, tingling, numbness, color or temperature changes of the toes. They should be encouraged to unwrap and loosen or remove compression and seek immediate emergency care in these situations. </li>
