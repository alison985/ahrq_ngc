<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Anal Canal Squamous-Cell Carcinoma (SCC)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Pretreatment Evaluation</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>A disease-specific history should be performed, emphasizing symptoms, risk factors, and signs of advanced disease. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C</strong>.
    <p>Risk factors associated with anal SCC include infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity, history of other HPV-related genital malignancies (cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN], vulvar cancer, or vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia); previous sexually acquired diseases, cigarette smoking, anoreceptive intercourse, multiple sexual partners, history of solid organ transplant, and other forms of immunosuppression. Because the incidence of anal cancer is higher in men practicing anoreceptive intercourse with men and those with HIV positivity, a high index of suspicion should be maintained in these patients presenting with anorectal complaints. Although potentially sensitive and difficult, inquiry to establish the presence or absence of these risk factors is important. Certain factors such as previous radiation, general medical issues, or inadequately controlled HIV may prove to be limiting or contraindications to chemoradiation therapy (CRT) or radical surgery, and are important to determine at the time of diagnosis.</p>
    </li>
    <li>A disease-specific physical examination should be performed to determine size, possible lymph node involvement, or metastatic disease. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B</strong>.
    <p>Physical examination should focus primarily on the anorectal examination and evaluation of the inguinal and femoral nodes. Digital rectal examination should be performed to identify the lesion location and to evaluate for fixation and the presence of sphincter invasion. Perirectal lymph nodes may be sometimes palpable. Anoscopy or proctoscopy with biopsy is essential to establish the size of the lesion, to determine the location within the anal canal, and to confirm diagnosis. Presence of palpable inguinal lymphadenopathy can suggest the need for fine-needle aspiration or core biopsy to confirm malignant involvement and help guide radiation fields. In general, metastatic disease is difficult to detect on physical examination, although a complete physical examination should be performed to help identify any potential sites of distant spread that may warrant further evaluation.</p>
    <p>The American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) local-regional staging for SCC of the anal canal focuses on the primary lesion size, the existence of local invasion, and the presence or absence of regional node disease. As such, clinical evaluation including size is critically important to determine proper staging (see Table 2 in the original guideline document). Invasion of the anal sphincter or perianal skin does not constitute a T4 lesion; however, this should be determined to aid in potential alterations in treatment.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Endoscopic and radiologic evaluation should be performed to help determine staging, and concomitant or metastatic disease. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B</strong>.
    <p>Biopsy should be performed under direct vision or through an anoscope or sigmoidoscope. Although anal cancer is not a risk factor for the development of colon cancer, colorectal neoplasms have been demonstrated in up to 15% of patients with anal cancer; therefore, colonoscopy should be performed to rule out synchronous colorectal neoplasms based on standard age and risk profile assessment. Chest, abdomen, and pelvic computed tomography (CT) should be performed to evaluate for lymphadenopathy, in particular, inguinal lymph node radiographic abnormalities that may warrant biopsy, and to exclude lung and liver metastases. Because SCC can metastasize not infrequently to the brain, head CT may be performed if clinical symptoms suggest involvement. In addition, evaluation of the primary tumor may be considered. Endoanal ultrasound (EAUS) and MRI are presently the 2 most accepted modalities and may be useful in determining primary tumor depth, evaluating sphincter involvement, and evaluating perirectal lymph node involvement, with data reporting increased accuracy and sensitivity over physical examination alone. MRI is comparable to EAUS for primary tumor size and nodal status and may be considered. Although not typically a part of the routine evaluation, <sup>18</sup>F-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT (FDG-PET/CT) has been shown to identify distant metastases that are not detected by physical examination or other imaging modalities in 17% to 25%, resulting in a reported change in treatment (i.e., radiotherapy) in up to 5% to 19% of cases.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Sentinel lymph node evaluation for detection of regional nodal metastases is still investigational. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C</strong>. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<p><em>Primary Treatment</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>The primary treatment for most SCCs of the anal canal should be combined modality CRT. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A</strong>.
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Intensity-modulated radiation therapy-based chemoradiotherapy (IMRT) may be considered to decrease treatment-related toxicity. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B</strong>. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Multidrug chemotherapy including mitomycin-C (MMC) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) along with radiation is usually preferable to other chemotherapy regimens with radiation. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A</strong>. </li>
    <li>Higher doses of radiation therapy without prolonged breaks in treatment are preferable when tolerated. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B</strong>. </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Treatment of Recurrent or Persistent Disease</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Abdominoperineal resection is effective salvage therapy for persistent or recurrent disease. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B</strong>. </li>
    <li>Systemic chemotherapy should be considered in patients with extrapelvic metastasis or recurrence following surgical salvage. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C</strong>. </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Management of Inguinal Lymph Node Disease</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Chemoradiation is the treatment of choice for inguinal lymph node disease. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C</strong>.
    <p>With the identification of any positive inguinal lymph node, bilateral inguinal basins should be incorporated into the radiation fields with the addition of a boost technique. Metachronous lymph nodes are seen in 10% to 20% of patients, normally within 6 months of completing treatment of the primary lesion. These metachronous nodes should also be treated with CRT, and typically respond well. Elective prophylactic lymphadenectomy is generally not warranted and is associated with high wound complication rates as well as lower-extremity complications. Selective inguinal node dissection may be considered for persistent disease following CRT.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Anal Cancer in HIV-Positive Patients</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>CD4 counts may be used to predict the outcome and tolerance of CRT in HIV-positive patients: <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C</strong>.
    <p>There is some controversy regarding CD4 count and correlation with outcome and toxicity, but, in general, this may be used for HIV-positive patients as a general guide along with clinical assessment. Patients with CD4 counts &amp;gt;200 cells/mL should typically be treated similarly to non-HIV-infected patients with anal cancer with the use of chemoradiation. CD4 counts &amp;lt;200 cells/mL have been shown to have higher toxicity, and treatment should be individualized. Treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy allows patients to better tolerate CRT and may improve local control, although higher overall rates of both acute and long-term toxicities have been reported.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Posttreatment Surveillance</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Follow-up examination should typically include anorectal examination including digital rectal examination, anoscopy, and inguinal palpation. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C</strong>.
    <p>Anal cancers regress both during and after CRT; therefore, follow-up should generally commence 6 to 12 weeks after the completion of treatment. Patients should normally be followed up at 3 to 6 months for the first 2 years, 6 to 12 months until 5 years, and annually thereafter, with varying intervals dictated by clinical findings. Recurrences are often amenable to further treatment that may result in cure. In general, at a minimum anorectal examination should consist of visual inspection, digital rectal examination, and anoscopy, along with inguinal palpation. Lesions occurring 3 or more months after the completion of primary CRT are concerning for persistent disease and should be biopsied because digital examination alone is unreliable for confirming residual malignancy.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Imaging studies such as endoanal ultrasound (EAUS), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and <sup>18</sup>F-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT (FDG-PET/CT) should be considered for posttreatment surveillance to assess for persistent or recurrent disease. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C</strong>. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Anal Margin Squamous-Cell Carcinoma</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>A disease-specific history and physical examination should be performed, emphasizing risk factors, tumor size, location, and signs of advanced disease. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C</strong>.
    <p>Staging of anal margin cancers by AJCC criteria follows that of skin cancer elsewhere, based on tumor size and lymph node involvement. Evaluation should consist of a perianal examination, including digital rectal examination, anoscopy, and palpation of the femoral and inguinal lymph node basins. T1-3 are staged the same manner as SCC of the anal canal, but T4 signifies invasion of deep extradermal structures such as bone, nerve, striated muscle, or cartilage. N0 and N1 refer to no regional or regional lymph node spread. In general, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be done to assess for distant metastasis.</p>
    <p>Treatment of anal margin SCC varies depending on size and depth of invasion. In general, T1 and early T2 lesions can be adequately treated with wide local excision (WLE) with a 1-cm margin, although close proximity to the anal canal may make this difficult. Definitive treatment by WLE alone for these early lesions has been associated with 5-year survival rates up to 88%. Primary radiation, combined with chemotherapy, is also an option, albeit less effective than appropriate excision. Small series with radiation alone have demonstrated failure rates of up to 36%. Larger cancers usually should be treated with upfront radiation to the inguinal nodal basins along with radiation or excision of the primary tumor. For T3 and T4 lesions, radiation to both inguinal regions and the pelvis along with chemotherapy with the use of 5-FU and MMC or cisplatin should normally be added. Abdominoperineal resection (APR) may be required for larger and deeper, less favorable lesions (T2-4 or N1), those involving the sphincter muscles, patients with incontinence, or patients with multiple recurrences after local excision. Salvage therapy for treatment failure after local excision can include repeat local excision, APR, and/or radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy. Accounting for size and location, tumors of the anal margin, especially larger ones, are associated with lower rates of overall and colostomy-free survival in comparison with anal canal lesions.</p>

    <li>A disease-specific history and physical examination should be performed for LGAIN/HGAIN, emphasizing symptoms, risk factors, and location of disease. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C</strong>. </li>
    <li>Anal Papanicolaou (Pap) smear cytological examination may be useful in the detection and follow-up of LGAIN/HGAIN. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C</strong>.
    <p>Screening procedures for LGAIN/HGAIN include anal cytology, colposcopy, biopsy, and high-resolution anoscopy (HRA). Based on numerous similarities between LGAIN/HGAIN and CIN, anal Pap smear cytology consists of using anal swabs to sample cells from the canal and has been instituted for both screening high-risk individuals and as surveillance after treatment for LGAIN/HGAIN.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Observation alone with close clinical follow-up may be considered in select cases for the management of LGAIN/HGAIN. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C</strong>. </li>
    <li>Topical 5% imiquimod cream with close long-term follow-up is an appropriate therapy for LGAIN/HGAIN of the anal margin. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C</strong>. </li>
    <li>Topical 5% 5-FU cream with close long-term follow-up is an appropriate therapy for LGAIN/HGAIN. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C</strong>. </li>
    <li>Photodynamic therapy with close long-term follow-up may be appropriate therapy for select patients with LGAIN/HGAIN. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C</strong>. </li>
    <li>Targeted destruction and close clinical long-term follow-up is appropriate therapy for LGAIN/HGAIN. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C</strong>. </li>
    <li>Patients with LGAIN/HGAIN should be offered close long-term clinical follow-up. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C</strong>.
    <p>Patients with LGAIN/HGAIN should typically be monitored for the development of recurrence, persistence, or progression to anal cancer. Surveillance examinations may be performed at 3- to 6-month intervals as long as dysplasia is present. This approach allows for the treatment of recurrent or persistent dysplasia or the detection of invasive anal SCC. Follow-up generally includes digital rectal examination, anoscopic examination, with or without the aid of magnification or the application of acetic acid and Lugol solution, and can be performed in an office setting. Anorectal cytology and/or biopsy may also be included, as indicated. The importance of close follow-up should be particularly emphasized among high-risk cohorts such as HIV-positive patients, patients with a history of other HPV-related genital malignancies, recipients of solid organ transplants, or men who have sex with men (MSM) who have been shown to have higher risk of persistence or recurrence of high-grade dysplasia (up to 80%) regardless of treatment modality.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) 16/18 may be considered in high-risk patients such as HIV-positive patients and MSM. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C</strong>. </li>
