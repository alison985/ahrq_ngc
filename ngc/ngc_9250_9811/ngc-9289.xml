      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Levels of recommendation (<strong>Standard, Guideline, and Option</strong>) and levels of evidence (<strong>High, Moderate, Low, Very Low</strong>) are defined at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Pharmacotherapy for Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Dopaminergic Medications</strong></p>
<p><em>Non-ergot Derived Dopamine Agonist: Pramipexole</em></p>
<p>Clinicians should treat patients with RLS with pramipexole. (<strong>STANDARD</strong>)</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Values and Trade-Offs</span>: Pramipexole is upgraded to standard from the previous practice parameter based on multiple studies showing efficacy in RLS. Pramipexole is typically well tolerated and side effects are self-limited with cessation of pramipexole therapy.</p>
<p><em>Non-ergot Derived Dopamine Agonist: Ropinirole</em></p>
<p>Clinicians should treat patients with RLS with ropinirole. (<strong>STANDARD</strong>)</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Values and Trade-Offs</span>: This recommendation is upgraded to standard from the previous practice parameter based on multiple studies with randomized controlled data (RCT) data showing efficacy in RLS therapy. Ropinirole is typically well tolerated and side effects are self-limited with cessation of ropinirole therapy.</p>
<p><em>Levodopa</em></p>
<p>Clinicians can treat RLS patients with levodopa with dopa decarboxylase inhibitor. (<strong>GUIDELINE</strong>)</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Values and Trade-Offs</span>: This recommendation is changed from the previous practice parameter, where it was given a STANDARD level of recommendation for use. Levodopa has longstanding clinical use in RLS with concomitant concerns for daytime RLS augmentation and early morning rebound of RLS symptoms. The use of levodopa may be most advantageous for those patients with intermittent RLS symptoms that do not require daily therapy. For those that require daily therapy for RLS, the newer dopaminergic agents may be a better choice. Therapy should be tailored to the individual patient's specific circumstances and needs. Vigilance for secondary impulsive behavior as an adverse reaction is needed.</p>
<p><em>Ergot-derived Dopamine Agonists: Pergolide and Cabergoline</em></p>
<p>Clinicians should not treat RLS patients with pergolide because of the risks of heart valve damage. (<strong>STANDARD</strong>)</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Values and Trade-Offs</span>: Pergolide risks include heart valve damage and retroperitoneal fibrosis making any future use of pergolide in RLS strongly contraindicated.</p>
<p>Given the potential of side effects, including heart valve damage, clinicians can treat RLS patients with cabergoline only if other recommended agents have been tried first and failed, and close clinical follow-up is provided. (<strong>GUIDELINE</strong>)</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Values and Trade-Offs</span>: The risks of cabergoline are sufficient to recommend cabergoline not be used in routine clinical practice for RLS particularly since there are multiple alternative RLS dopaminergic therapies with a better side effect profile. Because the risk is unclear, it is prudent to remain cautious with respect to recommending cabergoline.</p>
<p><strong>Opioid Medications</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians can treat RLS patients with opioids. (<strong>GUIDELINE</strong>)</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Values and Trade-Offs</span>: Opioid data shows clinical effectiveness in treating RLS with a low level of evidence. Side effects can include an undefined potential for abuse in predisposed patients and a possible risk for the development or worsening of sleep apnea. Therefore, patients should be clinically monitored for the development of symptoms. In general, however, this medication is very well tolerated and has a lower risk of augmentation than is seen in the dopaminergic medications.</p>
<p><strong>Anticonvulsant Medications</strong></p>
<p><em>Gabapentin Enacarbil</em></p>
<p>Clinicians can treat patients with RLS with gabapentin enacarbil. (<strong>GUIDELINE</strong>)</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Values and Trade-Offs</span>: This is a new recommendation from the prior practice parameter. Sufficient evidence has emerged since the last practice parameter to support gabapentin enacarbil as a guideline level for treatment in RLS therapy. Gabapentin enacarbil therapy is generally well tolerated with self-limited side effects. High level evidence is encouraging. However, this medication is relatively new, thereby warranting a conservative recommendation level of guideline at this time.</p>
<p><em>Gabapentin</em></p>
<p>Clinicians may treat RLS patients with gabapentin. (<strong>OPTION</strong>)</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Values and Trade-Offs</span>: Low level evidence supports use of gabapentin for RLS therapy. Pain relief with gabapentin supports consideration of gabapentin in patients with both RLS and pain. There are some concerning potential side effects which makes the balance of benefits versus harms uncertain.</p>
<p><em>Pregabalin</em></p>
<p>Clinicians may treat patients with RLS with pregabalin. (<strong>OPTION</strong>)</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Values and Trade-Offs</span>: Preliminary data shows therapeutic efficacy in pregabalin therapy for RLS. However, long-term follow up and published experience in pregabalin therapy for RLS is lacking. Thus, other better-studied RLS therapies should be considered before prescribing pregabalin.</p>
<p><em>Carbamazepine</em></p>
<p>Clinicians may treat RLS patients with carbamazepine. (<strong>OPTION</strong>)</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Values and Trade-offs</span>: This has been downgraded from GUIDELINE in the prior practice parameter to OPTION in this practice parameter. Although carbamazepine efficacy in RLS was shown in prior studies, these data are dated with no new additional supportive work. There are other RLS therapies with comparatively more supportive evidence, risk-to-benefit ratios, and clinical experience than carbamazepine. The benefits of carbamazepine therapy are closely balanced with potential adverse side effects which include sedation, liver abnormalities and, rarely, the potential suicidal ideation and behavior, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.</p>
<p><strong>Medications Acting on the Adrenergic Systems</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians may treat patients with RLS with clonidine. (<strong>OPTION</strong>)</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Values and Trade-Offs</span>: Clonidine has minimal supporting data in treating RLS and carries a considerable risk for side effects. Clonidine might be considered in treating hypertension and RLS concomitantly. The risk of side effects (such as hypotension in normotensive patients) associated with clonidine in the treatment of RLS makes the benefit-to-harm ratio unclear.</p>
<p><strong>Iron Supplementation</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians may use supplemental iron to treat RLS patients with low ferritin levels. (<strong>OPTION</strong>)</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Values and Trade-Offs</span>: RLS therapy with iron may be effective in patients with RLS associated with low ferritin levels. Parenteral high molecular weight iron dextran therapy carries the potential for anaphylactic reaction. The parenteral infusion risk with low molecular weight iron dextran is substantially lower. Moreover, parenteral iron therapy with iron sucrose, iron gluconate, or ferumoxytol carries no anaphylactic risk. However, whenever possible, oral iron replacement is recommended. Oral supplemental iron carries fewer side effects&amp;mdash;primarily constipation and rare cases of iron overload.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Therapies for Which No Recommendations Are Made</strong></span></p>
<p>Refer to the original guideline document for information on those pharmacological and nonpharmacological RLS therapies for which a recommendation level could not be given secondary to either insufficient evidence to support any recommendation or because the therapy is no longer available in the U.S.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Therapies for Periodic Limb Movements of Sleep (PLMS)</strong></span></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence at present to comment on the use of pharmacological therapy in patients diagnosed with periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) alone. (<strong>NO RECOMMENDATION</strong>)</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Values and Trade Offs</span>: There is insufficient evidence to comment on pharmacologic therapies in isolated PLMD. Existing data in RLS therapy does, in some cases, support some medical interventions in both RLS and PLMD. Clinical judgment must be used in any pharmacologic intervention in PLMD.</p>

<p>PICO questions were developed for the review, and are summarized in Table 1 of the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Meta-Analysis</strong></p>
<p>To compare the range of treatment options available for restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), one outcome measure was chosen for which the majority of studies presented data: the International Restless Legs Syndrome Rating Scale (IRLS). Data on other outcomes measures besides IRLS are summarized and presented in a descriptive manner for further information for the reader. Thus for medications that were studied prior to the development of the IRLS, meta-analysis was not performed. All meta-analyses were performed using MIX software. All analyses are presented using the random effects model.</p>
<p>The result of each meta-analysis is shown in a figure with several components in the original guideline document. Each study of the meta-analysis is identified along the left-hand column (study ID), and adjacent to it is the year of the study, treatment (exposed, &quot;e&quot;) results, and control (&quot;c&quot;) results. The results are expressed as &quot;n/M/SD&quot; corresponding to &quot;number/mean/standard deviation.&quot; A graphical representation of the data is shown in the center of the figure. The vertical red line indicates the average response of all studies. The zero line represents no effect. The width of the red diamond at the bottom of the plot represents the standard deviation of the meta-analysis. If the red diamond does not touch the zero line, the meta-analysis results indicate that the treatment is different from zero (i.e., it has an effect). The magnitude of the effect across all studies is given by the value of the association measure along with the 95% confidence intervals.</p>
<p>Tables of the data used in the meta-analyses are presented in the Appendix of the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The assessment of evidence quality was performed according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) process. The GRADE system differs from other grading systems as each study is not only evaluated for study design and risk of bias, but, additionally, an estimate of effect is generated for each outcome. Multiple aspects of quality are assessed including study limitations, imprecision, inconsistency of results, indirectness of evidence, and likeliness of publication bias. The quality of evidence from observational studies can be adjusted by the presence of large magnitudes of effect, evidence of dose-response associations, and all plausible confounders that increase the confidence in the estimated effects. Quality refers to the confidence that the estimates of the effects are correct, and the quality rating is applied to a body of evidence and not to individual studies.</p>
<p>Briefly, risk of bias includes aspects of study design (randomized control trials [RCTs] versus non-randomized controlled trials or before-after trials) and conduct such as blinding, allocation concealment, large loss to follow-up, or selective outcome reporting. Imprecision refers to wide confidence intervals around the estimate of effect when there are relatively few patients and few events. Indirectness occurs when the question being addressed is different than the available evidence regarding population, intervention, comparator, or outcome. There is inconsistency when there is unexplained heterogeneity of the results. Reporting bias can occur if there is selective reporting of studies or outcomes, which may occur if the published evidence is limited to a small number of trials funded by a for-profit organization.</p>
<p>As a first step, all individual studies were assessed by 2 task force members for study design, and limitations to validity (bias) for each outcome of interest. RCTs were considered a higher level of evidence than observational, nonrandomized, or before-after interventional studies (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field). Subsequently, the body of evidence for each outcome was assessed and graded, taking into account the results of the meta-analysis (if applicable) and other factors as described above. The final assessment, as defined in the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field, was determined for each treatment and outcome measure.</p>
<p>The results are reported as evidence profiles in each section that include the number of studies, study design, limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and other considerations that went into the quality of evidence for each outcome of interest. Also reported are the number of patients that were studied, the overall effect that was calculated in the meta-analysis (reported as the <em>mean difference</em> [MD]), and a qualitative assessment of the relative importance of the outcome.</p>
<p>One reviewer extracted the data and graded the studies and another verified this compiled information.</p></div>"/>

The assessment of evidence quality was performed according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) process. All individual studies were evaluated for study design, risk of bias, and an estimate of effect for each outcome measure.

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><em>Dopaminergic medications</em>. While these agents confer many benefits, there are some adverse effects that should be recognized. Similar to patients with Parkinson's disease, restless legs syndrome (RLS) patients treated with dopamine agonists may develop dopamine dysregulation syndrome. These patients may exhibit an addictive pattern of dopamine replacement therapy use and/or behavioral disturbances including punding and impulse control disorders such as pathologic gambling, compulsive shopping, compulsive eating, and hypersexuality. Case reports indicate that discontinuation of the dopamine agonist results in resolution or improvement of the impulse control disorder, although these patients may be particularly susceptible to dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome. Late development of augmentation (even after one year of continuous therapy on dopaminergic agents) remains a significant concern, and patients need to be monitored throughout therapy for this particular side effect. </li>
    <li><em>Pramipexole</em>. Pramipexole is well tolerated. It has been reported that adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate in intensity and typical for non-ergot dopamine agonists. These included nausea and somnolence, which typically decreased in frequency over time, and nasopharyngitis. </li>
    <li><em>Ropinirole</em>. Ropinirole was found to be effective and generally well tolerated. The most common side effects were nausea, headache, dizziness, somnolence, and vomiting. </li>
    <li><em>Levodopa</em>. Single doses of L-dopa, carbidopa, and entacapone (LCE) with up to 150 mg L-dopa were effective and also well tolerated without typical side effects such as nausea. Of note, Stalevo is on a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) watch list with concerns about possible increased risk of both prostate cancer and cardiovascular disease. Vigilance for secondary impulsive behavior as an adverse reaction is needed. </li>
    <li><em>Cabergoline</em>. Cabergoline is primarily indicated in treatment of prolactinoma with associated risk of visual field loss. Cabergoline carries a comparatively much stronger risk-to-benefit ratio in prolactinoma therapy than that seen in RLS therapy. Cabergoline risks include valvular heart disease. The data seem to agree that there is valve risk, but the defined risk in each study varies by incidence and degree of valve injury. Other side effects were mostly mild and transient and included nausea, dizziness, and headache. </li>
    <li><em>Opioids</em>. Side effects can include an undefined potential for abuse in predisposed patients and a possible risk for the development or worsening of sleep apnea. Therefore, patients should be clinically monitored for the development of symptoms. </li>
    <li><em>Gabapentin Enacarbil</em>. The most common adverse events were somnolence and dizziness, which were mild-to-moderate in intensity, and generally remitted. </li>
    <li><em>Gabapentin</em>. Gabapentin has the following potential side effects: sedation, dizziness, vision changes, and suicidal behavior and ideation. </li>
    <li><em>Carbamazepine</em>. Potential adverse side effects include sedation, liver abnormalities and, rarely, the potential suicidal ideation and behavior, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. </li>
    <li><em>Clonidine</em>. In one study, side effects were frequent but were generally considered mild, and included dry mouth, decreased cognition, lightheadedness, sleepiness post dose, constipation, decreased libido, and headache. The risk of side effects (such as hypotension in normotensive patients) associated with clonidine in the treatment of RLS makes the benefit-to-harm ratio unclear. </li>
    <li><em>Iron supplementation</em>. Anaphylactic symptoms are a risk. In 2009, the FDA issued a warning that anaphylactic-type reactions, including fatalities, have followed the parenteral administration of iron dextran injection. The boxed warning recommends administering a test dose prior to the first therapeutic dose and observing reactions. However, it should be noted that parenteral infusion risk with low molecular weight iron dextran is lower (1 per 200,000) than that with high molecular weight iron dextran. Additionally, parenteral iron therapy with iron sucrose, iron gluconate or ferumoxytol carries no anaphylactic risk. </li>
