<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Initial Assessment and Risk Stratification</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Hemodynamic status should be assessed immediately upon presentation and resuscitative measures begun as needed (<strong>Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Blood transfusions should target hemoglobin &amp;ge;7 g/dl, with higher hemoglobins targeted in patients with clinical evidence of intravascular volume depletion or comorbidities such as coronary artery disease (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low-to-moderate-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Risk assessment should be performed to stratify patients into higher and lower risk categories, and may assist in initial decisions such as timing of endoscopy, time of discharge, and level of care (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Discharge from the emergency department without inpatient endoscopy may be considered in patients with urea nitrogen &amp;lt;18.2 mg/dl; hemoglobin &amp;ge;13.0 g/dl for men (12.0 g/dl for women), systolic blood pressure &amp;ge;110 mm Hg; pulse &amp;lt;100 beats/min; and absence of melena, syncope, cardiac failure, and liver disease, as they have &amp;lt;1% chance of requiring intervention (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Pre-Endoscopic Medical Therapy</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Prokinetic Therapy</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;5&quot;>
    <li>Intravenous infusion of erythromycin (250 mg ~30 min before endoscopy) should be considered to improve diagnostic yield and decrease the need for repeat endoscopy. However, erythromycin has not consistently been shown to improve clinical outcomes (<strong>Conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Proton Pump Inhibitor Therapy</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;6&quot;>
    <li>Pre-endoscopic intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) (e.g., 80 mg bolus followed by 8 mg/h infusion) may be considered to decrease the proportion of patients who have higher risk stigmata of hemorrhage at endoscopy and who receive endoscopic therapy. However, PPIs do not improve clinical outcomes such as further bleeding, surgery, or death (<strong>Conditional recommendation, high-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>If endoscopy will be delayed or cannot be performed, intravenous PPI is recommended to reduce further bleeding (<strong>Conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Gastric Lavage</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;8&quot;>
    <li>Nasogastric or orogastric lavage is not required in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) for diagnosis, prognosis, visualization, or therapeutic effect (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Endoscopy for Diagnosis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Timing of Endoscopy</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;9&quot;>
    <li>Patients with UGIB should generally undergo endoscopy within 24 h of admission, following resuscitative efforts to optimize hemodynamic parameters and other medical problems (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>In patients who are hemodynamically stable and without serious comorbidities endoscopy should be performed as soon as possible in a non-emergent setting to identify the substantial proportion of patients with low-risk endoscopic findings who can be safely discharged (<strong>Conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>In patients with higher risk clinical features (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension, bloody emesis or nasogastric aspirate in hospital) endoscopy within 12 h may be considered to potentially improve clinical outcomes (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Endoscopic Diagnosis of Ulcer and Stigmata of Recent Hemorrhage</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;12&quot;>
    <li>Stigmata of recent hemorrhage (SRH) should be recorded as they predict risk of further bleeding and guide management decisions. The stigmata, in descending risk of further bleeding, are active spurting, non-bleeding visible vessel, active oozing, adherent clot, flat pigmented spot, and clean base (<strong>Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Endoscopic Therapy</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Who Should Receive Endoscopic Therapy?</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;13&quot;>
    <li>Endoscopic therapy should be provided to patients with active spurting or oozing bleeding or a non-bleeding visible vessel (<strong>Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence</strong>) (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document). </li>
    <li>Endoscopic therapy may be considered for patients with an adherent clot resistant to vigorous irrigation. Benefit may be greater in patients with clinical features potentially associated with a higher risk of rebleeding (e.g., older age, concurrent illness, inpatient at time bleeding began) (<strong>Conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Endoscopic therapy should not be provided to patients who have an ulcer with a clean base or a flat pigmented spot (<strong>Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What Endoscopic Therapies Should Be Used?</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;16&quot;>
    <li>Epinephrine therapy should not be used alone. If used, it should be combined with a second modality (<strong>Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Thermal therapy with bipolar electrocoagulation or heater probe and injection of sclerosant (e.g., absolute alcohol) are recommended because they decrease further bleeding, need for surgery, and mortality (<strong>Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Clips are recommended because they appear to decrease further bleeding and need for surgery. However, comparisons of clips versus other therapies yield variable results and currently used clips have not been well studied (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low-to-moderate quality evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>For the subset of patients with actively bleeding ulcers, thermal therapy or epinephrine plus a second modality may be preferred over clips or sclerosant alone to achieve initial hemostasis (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low-to-moderate-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Medical Therapy after Endoscopy</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;20&quot;>
    <li>After successful endoscopic hemostasis, intravenous PPI therapy with 80 mg bolus followed by 8 mg/h continuous infusion for 72 h should be given to patients who have an ulcer with active bleeding, a non-bleeding visible vessel, or an adherent clot (<strong>Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence</strong>) (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document). </li>
    <li>Patients with ulcers that have flat pigmented spots or clean bases can receive standard PPI therapy (e.g., oral PPI once-daily) (<strong>Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Repeat Endoscopy</span></strong> </p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;22&quot;>
    <li>Routine second-look endoscopy, in which repeat endoscopy is performed 24 h after initial endoscopic hemostatic therapy, is not recommended (<strong>Conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Repeat endoscopy should be performed in patients with clinical evidence of recurrent bleeding and hemostatic therapy should be applied in those with higher risk stigmata of hemorrhage (<strong>Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>If further bleeding occurs after a second endoscopic therapeutic session, surgery or interventional radiology with transcathether arterial embolization is generally employed (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Hospitalization for Patients with UGIB</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;25&quot;>
    <li>Patients with high-risk stigmata (active bleeding, visible vessels, clots) should generally be hospitalized for 3 days assuming no rebleeding and no other reason for hospitalization. They may be fed clear liquids soon after endoscopy (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Patients with clean-based ulcers may receive a regular diet and be discharged after endoscopy assuming they are hemodynamically stable, their hemoglobin is stable, they have no other medical problems, and they have a residence where they can be observed by a responsible adult (<strong>Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Long-Term Prevention of Recurrent Bleeding Ulcers</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;27&quot;>
    <li>Patients with <em>Helicobacter pylori</em>-associated bleeding ulcers should receive <em>H. pylori</em> therapy. After documentation of eradication, maintenance antisecretory therapy is not needed unless the patient also requires non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or antithrombotics (<strong>Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence</strong>) (see Figure 2 in the original guideline document). </li>
    <li>In patients with NSAID-associated bleeding ulcers, the need for NSAIDs should be carefully assessed and NSAIDs should not be resumed if possible. In patients who must resume NSAIDs, a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-selective NSAID at the lowest effective dose plus daily PPI is recommended (<strong>Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>In patients with low-dose aspirin-associated bleeding ulcers, the need for aspirin should be assessed. If given for secondary prevention (i.e., established cardiovascular disease) then aspirin should be resumed as soon as possible after bleeding ceases in most patients: ideally within 1 to 3 days and certainly within 7 days. Long-term daily PPI therapy should also be provided. If given for primary prevention (i.e., no established cardiovascular disease), antiplatelet therapy likely should not be resumed in most patients (<strong>Conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>In patients with idiopathic (non-<em>H. pylori</em>, non-NSAID) ulcers, long-term antiulcer therapy (e.g., daily PPI) is recommended (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Quality of Evidence Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) System</strong></p>
<p>The quality of evidence, which influences the strength of recommendation, ranges from &quot;high&quot; (further research is very unlikely to change the guideline authors' confidence in the estimate of effect) to &quot;moderate&quot; (further research is likely to have an important impact on the guideline authors' confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate) to &quot;low&quot; (further research is very likely to have an important impact on the guideline authors' confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate), and &quot;very low&quot; (any estimate of effect is very uncertain).</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations Using the GRADE System</strong></p>
<p>The strength of a recommendation is graded as strong when the desirable effects of an intervention clearly outweigh the undesirable effects and is graded as conditional when uncertainty exists about the trade-offs. In addition to quality of evidence and balance between desirable and undesirable effects, other factors affecting the strength of recommendation include variability in values and preferences of patients, and whether an intervention represents a wise use of resources.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Endoscopy for Diagnosis &amp;mdash; Timing of Endoscopy</strong></p>
<p><em>Low-risk patients</em>. A randomized trial compared endoscopy within 2 h versus endoscopy within 48 h in 110 patients who were hemodynamically stable, had no serious comorbidity, and had no reason to suspect variceal bleeding. No significant improvements in end points such as bleeding, surgery, or mortality were identified. However, the length of hospital stay, post-discharge unplanned physician visits, and costs were significantly decreased in the early endoscopy group. Forty-six percent of patients in the early endoscopy group could be discharged home immediately and had no rebleeding or repeat endoscopy during the next month.</p>
<p>In a second randomized trial comparing early endoscopy within 6 h versus within 48 h in 93 patients with hemodynamic stabilization and absence of severe comorbidity, no significant benefits were seen in clinical end points or in resource utilization. Although discharge without hospitalization was recommended in the 40% of early endoscopy patients who met criteria for early discharge, this advice was followed in only 9%, suggesting that the financial benefit of early endoscopy can only be realized if physicians use the results of endoscopy in making management decisions.</p>
<p>Thus, both studies suggest that early endoscopy in patients who are hemodynamically stable and have no serious comorbidities can potentially result in lower costs by allowing early discharge in up to ~ 40&amp;ndash;45% of patients, supporting performance of endoscopy as soon as possible in patients with low-risk clinical features. However, the lack of clinical benefit argues against the need for endoscopy in an emergent setting (e.g., &quot;middle of the night&quot;) for low-risk patients. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, patients with very low risk based on pre-endoscopic assessment (e.g., Blatchford score of 0) may be considered for discharge from the emergency department without undergoing endoscopy.</p>
<p><strong>Second-Look Endoscopy</strong></p>
<p>The expense of second-look endoscopy also must be considered. A large number of unnecessary endoscopies will be performed since most patients do not have recurrent bleeding. In addition, second-look endoscopies do not prevent further bleeding in all patients, and repeat endoscopic therapy is successful in most patients with rebleeding. An economic analysis suggests that intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy would be the dominant strategy as compared with second-look endoscopy if the PPI therapy reduced rebleeding to 9% or if it cost $10 per day. Recent randomized trials report rebleeding rates &amp;lt;9% in patients with high-risk ulcer bleeding treated with endoscopic and PPI therapy. Furthermore, intensive PPI therapy is considered as standard therapy after endoscopic therapy of high-risk stigmata of recent hemorrhage (SRH) and would be employed even if second-look endoscopy is done.</p></div>"/>
