	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions of the classification of the evidence (<strong>Class I-IV</strong>) and the levels of the recommendations (<strong>A,B, C, U</strong>) are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Accuracy of Neuromuscular Ultrasound</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em>. Based on consistent Class I and Class II evidence, neuromuscular ultrasound measurement of median nerve cross-sectional area at the wrist is established as accurate for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em>. If available, neuromuscular ultrasound measurement of median nerve cross-sectional area at the wrist may be offered as an accurate diagnostic test for CTS (<strong>Level A</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Clinical Context</em>. As is the case with all ultrasonographic imaging, neuromuscular ultrasound of the median nerve at the wrist should be performed and interpreted by clinicians experienced with the technique. Scanning protocols and reference values for median nerve cross-sectional area at the wrist should be established by each laboratory prior to using neuromuscular ultrasound for the diagnosis of CTS.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Added Value of Neuromuscular Ultrasound</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em>. Based on Class II evidence, neuromuscular ultrasound of the wrist probably adds value to electrodiagnostic studies when assessing CTS as it can detect structural abnormalities.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em>: If available, neuromuscular ultrasound should be considered to screen for structural abnormalities at the wrist in those with CTS (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Clinical Context</em>. Screening for structural abnormalities at the wrist that cause CTS is likely to be of higher yield in those with atypical CTS. This was demonstrated by a study which found a high rate of occult ganglia only in those with unilateral CTS. This is an atypical presentation, as most patients have bilateral CTS (defined by symptoms, nerve conduction studies, or both). Other atypical presentations of CTS include sudden onset and onset in the setting of trauma. Although ultrasound can identify structural abnormalities, it is possible these abnormalities may not always be the underlying cause of the median mononeuropathy. In addition, the prevalence of such abnormalities in the general population is not known, so the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound for the identification of these structures cannot be calculated based on currently available data. The wide prevalence range for bifid median nerves (2%&amp;ndash;13%) may be secondary to ultrasound device resolution (earlier studies identified fewer bifid nerves), ultrasound technique and site of imaging within the wrist, or patient population. The presence of structures such as persistent median arteries and accessory muscles is clearly of therapeutic interest, as it may alter the choice of interventional approach (either injection or surgery). Knowledge of a bifid median nerve and other anatomic variants is also of interest in planning the treatment of CTS, and identification of such variants prior to invasive intervention can even assist later in the assessment of failed intervention. In addition, the presence of a bifid median nerve may be an independent risk factor for the development of CTS.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Context Summary for All Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>A single neuromuscular ultrasound evaluation of the wrist in those with CTS allows for assessment of both median nerve cross-sectional area and the presence of structural abnormalities, and this complements well the information obtained during an electrodiagnostic study (which is the gold standard for diagnosis of CTS). Some variability exists in the devices, scanning protocols, and reference ranges for the diagnosis of CTS when using neuromuscular ultrasound, but this is to be expected. As a comparison, similar variability exists in electrodiagnostic techniques. It is anticipated that with continued experience with neuromuscular ultrasound techniques, more uniformity will occur as consensus develops regarding optimal use of the technology. It should also be noted that many studies have proposed other neuromuscular ultrasound parameters that can be used to assist in the diagnosis of CTS, but these were not assessed in this guideline. These include median nerve flattening ratios; measures of median nerve mobility, echogenicity, and vascularity; and measures of flexor retinaculum bowing.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Definitions</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong>American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Classification of the Evidence for Rating of a Diagnostic Article</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: A cohort study with prospective data collection of a broad spectrum of persons with the suspected condition, using an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The diagnostic test is objective or performed and interpreted without knowledge of the patient's clinical status. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: A case&amp;ndash;control study of a broad spectrum of persons with the condition established by an acceptable reference standard compared with a broad spectrum of controls, or a cohort study with a broad spectrum of persons with the suspected condition where the data were collected retrospectively. The diagnostic test is objective or performed and interpreted without knowledge of disease status. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: A case&amp;ndash;control study or cohort study where either persons with the condition or controls are of a narrow spectrum. The condition is established by an acceptable reference standard. The reference standard and diagnostic test are objective or performed and interpreted by different observers. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong>: Studies not meeting Class I, II, or III criteria, including consensus, expert opinion, or a case report.</p>
<p><strong>American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Classification of the Evidence for Rating of a Screening Article</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: A statistical, population-based sample of patients studied at a uniform point in time (usually early) during the course of the condition. All patients undergo the intervention of interest. The outcome, if not objective, is determined in an evaluation that is masked to the patients' clinical presentations.</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: A statistical, non-referral clinic-based sample of patients studied at a uniform point in time (usually early) during the course of the condition. Most patients undergo the intervention of interest. The outcome, if not objective, is determined in an evaluation that is masked to the patients' clinical presentations.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: A sample of patients studied during the course of the condition. Some patients undergo the intervention of interest. The outcome, if not objective, is determined in an evaluation by someone other than the treating physician.</p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong>: Studies not meeting Class I, II, or III criteria, including consensus, expert opinion, or a case report.</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The four possible recommendation classifications include:</p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective, or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.) [In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an &quot;A&quot; recommendation if: (1) all criteria are met; and (2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &amp;gt;5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &amp;gt;2.]</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective, or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective, or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p></div>"/>

<p>In May 2011, PubMed was used to search Medline to identify all potential abstracts. The search terms &quot;carpal tunnel syndrome OR median nerve OR median neuropathy&quot; were combined with the terms &quot;ultrasound OR ultrasonography OR sonogram OR sonography.&quot; This produced 724 articles from 1990 to May 2011. This was narrowed to 641 articles by including &quot;English-only&quot; and &quot;human-only&quot; studies. The titles of those articles were reviewed for relevance, which yielded 240 articles, and each abstract was then reviewed by at least two investigators. This resulted in 121 articles for full manuscript review. After each article was reviewed in its entirety by two investigators, 67 were identified as relevant for this guideline. In order to be considered relevant, the article had to describe the use of ultrasound to image the wrist in individuals suspected of having carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>2017 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline developer searched Medline using the following search terms: carpal tunnel syndrome, median nerve, ultrasonography, and high resolution ultrasound. The literature search was performed for March 2011 through March 2017. The inclusion/exclusion criteria remained the same as for the original manuscript: &quot;Articles pertaining to the accuracy of median nerve cross-sectional area measurements for the diagnosis of CTS were assessed using the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) criteria for rating an article on diagnostic accuracy, and articles pertaining to neuromuscular ultrasound as a screening tool to identify anatomic explanations for CTS were assessed using AAN criteria for rating a screening article&amp;hellip;In order to be considered relevant, the article had to describe the use of ultrasound to image the wrist in individuals suspected of having CTS.&quot;</p></div>"/>

<p>The American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) convened an expert panel of physicians specializing in neurology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and radiology, selected to represent a broad range of expertise related to neuromuscular ultrasound and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Some panel participants reported using neuromuscular ultrasound frequently for clinical and research purposes, and others reported never using the technology. All panel participants had expertise in the clinical and electrodiagnostic assessment of CTS.</p>
<p>Two questions were asked: (1) What is the accuracy of median nerve cross-sectional area enlargement as measured with ultrasound for the diagnosis of CTS? (2) What added value, if any, does neuromuscular ultrasound provide over electrodiagnostic studies alone for the diagnosis of CTS?</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>2017 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>Each publication was reviewed by 2 reviewers to determine if any of the new articles contradicted or provided alternative explanations of the relationship of the sensitivity and/ specificity of ultrasound imaging in the evaluation of CTS. We reviewed each article to see if it might lead to a different conclusion than the original guideline. Since there was not sufficient evidence to contradict the original conclusion, the board of the AANEM, on the recommendation of the Practice Issues Review Panel, reaffirmed the Guidelines on the use of ultrasound in the assessment of carpal tunnel syndrome.</p></div>"/>
