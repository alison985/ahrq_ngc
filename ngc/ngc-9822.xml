<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>A medical history and physical examination along with the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) laboratory test should be performed every six months for five years. </li>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Which Symptoms/Signs Potentially Signify a Recurrence of CRC and Warrant Investigation?</span></strong></p>
<p>In the expert opinion of the authors, any new and persistent or worsening symptom warrants the consideration of a recurrence, especially:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Abdominal pain, particularly in the right upper quadrant or flank (liver area) </li>
    <li>Dry cough </li>
    <li>Vague constitutional symptoms such as:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Fatigue </li>
        <li>Nausea </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Unexplained weight loss </li>
    <li>Signs and/or symptoms specific to rectal cancer:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Pelvic pain </li>
        <li>Sciatica </li>
        <li>Difficulty with urination or defecation </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>There are no signs of symptoms specific to colon cancer that would not also apply to rectal cancer. </li>
    <li>Table 2 in the original guideline document provides an estimate of the percentage of patients with recurrence at five years by site of recurrence. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>What Are the Common and/or Significant Long-term and Late Effects of CRC Treatment?</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>On What Secondary Prevention Measures Should CRC Survivors Be Counselled?</span></strong></p>
<p>Despite the lack of high-quality evidence on secondary prevention in CRC survivors, the following counselling goals would be reasonable based on lower levels of evidence and the expert opinion of the authors:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Maintain an ideal body weight. </li>
    <li>Engage in a physically active lifestyle. </li>
    <li>Eat a healthy diet. </li>
    <li>There are insufficient data to make a firm recommendation regarding the role of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in the secondary prevention of CRC. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Is There a Preferred Model of Follow-up Care in Ontario?</span></strong></p>
<p>The most common practice for follow-up care in Ontario involves specialist-coordinated care within an institution. Emerging evidence suggests that, for CRC cancer survivors who have completed all their treatment, discharge from specialist-led care to community-based family physician-coordinated or institution-based nurse-coordinated care is a reasonable option.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Literature Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>For research questions 1-5, the literature search involved an Internet search for guidelines relevant to the research questions, using the Program in Evidence-base Care (PEBC) preferred list (Table 1 in the original guideline document) of guideline developers and guideline directories of Canadian and international health organizations and the National Guideline Clearinghouse. The intent of this search was to create a comprehensive list of all existing guidelines, based on evidence relevant to the project. These web sites/databases were searched from 2000 through June 2011 using the following keywords: &quot;colorectal cancer&quot;, &quot;surveillance&quot;, &quot;follow up&quot;, &quot;survival&quot;, &quot;survivor&quot;, &quot;recurrence&quot;, &quot;preventive&quot;, &quot;prevention&quot;, and &quot;late effects&quot;. In addition, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, along with the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), were also searched from 2000 through June 2011 using the same keywords. Appendix 2 in the original guideline document details the literature search strategies used in MEDLINE and EMBASE, and a similar search strategy was used in the CDSR.</p>
<p>For research question 6, studies were pulled from the PEBC's Evidence-based Series (EBS) 26-1: Models of Care for Cancer Survivorship guideline. This systematic review used OVID to search the MEDLINE (R) and EMBASE databases for articles assessing the impact of model(s) of care for post-treatment cancer survivors, published between 2000 and week 13 of 2012. Key terms were purposely broad and included: &quot;cancer&quot;, &quot;survivor&quot;, &quot;follow-up care&quot; and &quot;after care&quot;, with a subsequent randomized controlled trial (RCT) and systematic review filter. In addition, reference lists of primary articles were scanned for potentially useful studies, and selected journals were hand-searched (e.g., Journal of Cancer Survivorship).</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Articles were selected for inclusion in this systematic review, if they were:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines providing guidance on follow-up and/or surveillance procedures, signs and symptoms of recurrence, late and/or long-term adverse effects of treatment, or secondary prevention measures in adult survivors of colorectal cancer (CRC) (patients who had a primary diagnosis of CRC, completed treatment, and show no symptoms of recurrence or development of metastases); or, </li>
    <li>Systematic reviews and meta-analyses investigating the signs and symptoms of recurrence, late and long-term adverse effects of treatment, or secondary prevention measures for adult survivors of CRC (as defined previously). </li>
</ul>
<p>On a question by question basis, if current and high-quality clinical practice guidelines were identified, they would be included and the evidentiary bases from those guidelines used to inform the relevant questions. In addition, systematic reviews and meta-analyses would not be selected in the primary literature search. A priori, the Working Group was aware that several high-quality guidelines existed that would inform Questions 1 and 2. In the event that clinical practice guidelines, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses were not identified to inform Questions 3 (signs and symptoms of CRC recurrence), 4 (common and significant late or long-term effects of CRC treatment), and 5 (secondary prevention measures for CRC), the Group would develop recommendations based on expert clinical opinion and consensus. As lower quality observational studies were likely to form the evidence base that would inform those questions, the Group agreed that an extensive and exhaustive literature search for such studies should not be conducted as they would not contribute to the development of definitive recommendations.</p>

<p>Non-English guidelines were excluded, as translation funding was not available.</p></div>"/>

<p>Data on the recommended follow-up and surveillance procedures for colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors were extracted.

<p><strong>Quality Appraisal of Clinical Practice Guidelines and Systematic Reviews</strong></p>
<p>The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) Instrument was applied to any clinical practice guidelines that met the inclusion criteria. The AGREE II Instrument evaluates the process of practice guideline development and the quality of reporting. The Standards and Guidelines Evidence (SAGE) Inventory of Cancer Guidelines was searched for a record of each included guideline, because AGREE II evaluations are conducted and reported for all guidelines in the inventory.

    <li>On what secondary prevention measures should CRC survivors be counselled? </li>
    <li>Are there preferred models of follow-up care in Ontario, i.e., should patient follow-up be done by a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, surgeon, advanced practice nurse, physician assistant, or primary care provider (e.g., family physician, nurse practitioner, family practice nurse)? </li>
</ol>
<p>The Evidence-based Series (EBS) guidelines developed by the Program in Evidence-Based Care, Cancer Care Ontario (PEBC, CCO) use the methods of the Practice Guidelines Development Cycle. For this project, the Colorectal Cancer Survivorship Working Group was aware that there are a number of national and international groups that have developed high-quality guidelines on the topic of follow up after curative resection of CRC. Therefore, the core methodology used to develop the evidentiary base was the systematic review of practice guidelines. Evidence was selected by one methodologist and reviewed directly by three members of the Working Group. A broad range of health professionals such as primary care physicians, radiologists and other imaging professionals, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, surgeons, and nurses/nurse practitioners was given the opportunity to review the guideline and provide input in order to develop consensus.</p>
<p>The systematic review is a convenient and up-to-date source of the best available evidence on follow-up, surveillance, and secondary prevention protocols for CRC survivors. The body of evidence in this review is primarily comprised of clinical practice guidelines. That evidence forms the basis of the recommendations developed by the Working Group and published in Section 1 of the original guideline document. The systematic review and companion recommendations are intended to promote evidence-based practice in Ontario, Canada.</p>

<p>Prior to the submission of this Evidence-based Series (EBS) draft report for External Review, the report was reviewed and approved by two members of the Program in Evidence-based Care (PEBC) Report Approval Panel, a panel that includes oncologists and whose members have clinical and methodological expertise.</p>
<p><strong>External Review by Ontario Clinicians and Other Experts</strong></p>
<p>The PEBC external review process is two-pronged and includes a targeted peer review that is intended to obtain direct feedback on the draft report from a small number of specified content experts and a professional consultation that is intended to facilitate dissemination of the final guidance report to Ontario practitioners.</p>
<p>Following the review and discussion of Section 1: Recommendations and Section 2: Evidentiary Base of this EBS and the review and approval of the report by the PEBC Report Approval Panel, the Colorectal Cancer (CRC) Survivors Guideline Development Group (GDG) circulated Sections 1 and 2 to external review participants for review and feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<p><em>Targeted Peer Review</em>: During the guideline development process, seven targeted peer reviewers from Ontario considered to be clinical and/or methodological experts on the topic were identified by the working group. Several weeks prior to completion of the draft report, the nominees were contacted by email and asked to serve as reviewers. Four reviewers agreed and the draft report and a questionnaire were sent via email for their review. The questionnaire consisted of items evaluating the methods, results, and interpretive summary used to inform the draft recommendations and whether the draft recommendations should be approved as a guideline. Written comments were invited. The questionnaire and draft document were sent out on November 8, 2011. Follow-up reminders were sent at two weeks (email) and at four weeks (telephone call). The CRC Survivors working group reviewed the results of the survey.</p>
<p><em>Professional Consultation</em>: Feedback was obtained through a brief online survey of health care professionals who are the intended users of the guideline. All individuals in the PEBC database with an interest in Primary Care and in either gastrointestinal cancer or colonoscopy were contacted by email to inform them of the survey. A total of 439 individuals were contacted. Participants were asked to rate the overall quality of the guideline (Section 1 in the original guideline document) and whether they would use and/or recommend it. Written comments were invited. Participants were contacted by email and directed to the survey website where they were provided with access to the survey, the guideline recommendations (Section 1 in the original guideline document) and the evidentiary base (Section 2 in the original guideline document). The notification email was sent on November 8, 2011. The consultation period ended on December 15, 2011. The CRC Survivors working group reviewed the results of the survey.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>This EBS report reflects the integration of feedback obtained through the external review process with final approval given by the CRC Survivors GDG and the Report Approval Panel of the PEBC.</p>
<p><strong>Gastrointestinal Cancer Disease Site Group (GI DSG) Endorsement Vote</strong></p>
<p>Simultaneously with the external review of this EBS draft report, the report was circulated to the GI DSG of the PEBC. In October 2011 the GI DSG was asked to vote on whether or not they endorse this EBS. On two separate occasions, an email of the ballot question and ballot were sent to the entire GI DSG membership. At that time the GI DSG consisted of 27 members comprised of medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, surgeons, and a community representative. Prior to the commencement of the endorsement vote, the DSG co-chairs set a minimum threshold for endorsement of a majority of voting members plus one. A total of seven eligible ballots were cast. Of those, four members voted in favour of endorsement of this EBS, one member voted against endorsement, one member did not specify yes or no, and there was one abstention. The results of this vote were discussed at a GI DSG meeting on December 6, 2011. Refer to Section 3 of the original guideline document for additional details.</p></div>"/>

    <li>Development of standards for overuse and underuse against which practice can be measured and reported </li>
    <li>The evidence suggests that when colon cancer survivors were followed by a community-based family physician, there were no significant differences for rates of recurrence; time-to-detection of recurrence; death rates; or physical, psychosocial or quality-of-life components compared to survivors who were followed by an institutional-based specialist. This finding can reasonably be applied to both colon and rectal cancer populations as the follow-up care trajectories are very similar. The working group was unable to find comparative studies investigating the role of nurse-coordinated follow-up of CRC cancer survivors. The recommendation that CRC cancer survivors may be followed by nurses is based on the success of nurse-coordinated follow-up of breast cancer survivors and on the similarity in the follow-up care trajectory between CRC and breast cancers, in settings where guideline recommended visits and testing can be organized by physicians or nurses within the institutional setting. </li>
