	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong>Predicting Preeclampsia</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Women should be screened for clinical risk markers of preeclampsia from early pregnancy. (<strong>II-2C</strong>) See Table 6 in the original guideline document. </li>
    <li>Consultation with an obstetrician or an obstetric internist, by telephone if necessary, should be considered for women with a history of previous preeclampsia or another strong clinical marker of increased preeclampsia risk, particularly multiple pregnancy, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, significant proteinuria at first antenatal visit (usually early in pregnancy), or a pre-existing condition of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or renal disease. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Screening using biomarkers or Doppler ultrasound velocimetry of the uteroplacental circulation cannot be recommended routinely at present for women at low or increased risk of preeclampsia until such screening has been shown to improve pregnancy outcome. (<strong>II-2C</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Preventing Preeclampsia and Its Complications in Women at Low Risk</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;4&quot;>
    <li>Calcium supplementation of at least 1 g/d, orally, is recommended for women with low dietary intake of calcium (&amp;lt;600 mg/d). (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>The following are recommended for other established beneficial effects in pregnancy: abstention from alcohol for prevention of fetal alcohol effects (<strong>II-2E</strong>), exercise for maintenance of fitness (<strong>I-A</strong>), periconceptual use of a folate-containing multivitamin for prevention of neural tube defects (<strong>I-A</strong>), and smoking cessation for prevention of low birthweight and preterm birth. (<strong>I-E</strong>) </li>
    <li>Periconceptual and ongoing use of a folate-containing multivitamin (<strong>I-B</strong>) or exercise (<strong>II-2B</strong>) may be useful in preventing preeclampsia. </li>
    <li>Prostaglandin precursors and supplementation with magnesium or zinc are <strong>not</strong> recommended for preeclampsia prevention, but may be useful for prevention of other pregnancy complications. (<strong>I-C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Dietary salt restriction during pregnancy (<strong>I-D</strong>), calorie restriction during pregnancy for overweight women (<strong>I-D</strong>), low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (<strong>I-E</strong>), vitamins C and E (based on current evidence) (<strong>I-E</strong>), and thiazide diuretics (<strong>I-E</strong>) are not recommended. </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation about a heart-healthy diet (<strong>II-2L</strong>); workload or stress reduction (including bedrest) (<strong>II-2L</strong>); supplementation with iron with or without folate (<strong>I-L</strong>); vitamin D (<strong>I-L</strong>); pyridoxine (<strong>I-L</strong>); or food rich in flavonoids. (<strong>I-L</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Preventing Preeclampsia and Its Complications in Women at Increased Risk</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;10&quot;>
    <li>Low-dose acetylsalicylic acid and calcium supplementation (of at least 1 g/d) for women with low calcium intake are recommended for preventions of preeclampsia in women at high risk. (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Acetylsalicylic acid should be: taken in a low dose (75 to 162 mg/d), (<strong>III-B</strong>) administered at bedtime, (<strong>I-B</strong>) initiated after diagnosis of pregnancy but before 16 weeks' gestation, (<strong>I-B</strong>) and considered for continuation until delivery. (<strong>I-C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Prophylactic doses of low-molecular-weight heparin may be discussed in women with previous placental complications (including preeclampsia) to prevent the recurrence of severe or early-onset preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and/or infants that are small for gestational age. (<strong>I-B</strong>) </li>
    <li>The following may be useful: L-arginine (<strong>I-B</strong>), increased rest at home in the third trimester (<strong>I-C</strong>), and reduction of workload or stress. (<strong>III-C</strong>) </li>
    <li>The following may be useful for prevention of other pregnancy complications: prostaglandin precursors (<strong>I-B</strong>), magnesium supplementation (<strong>I-C</strong>), and heparin to prevent venous thromboembolic disease. (<strong>I-B</strong>) </li>
    <li>The following are recommended for other established beneficial effects in pregnancy (as discussed for women at low risk of preeclampsia): abstention from alcohol (<strong>II-2E</strong>), periconceptual use of a folate-containing multivitamin (<strong>I-A</strong>), and smoking cessation. (<strong>I-E</strong>) </li>
    <li>The following are <strong>not</strong> recommended: calorie restriction in overweight women during pregnancy (<strong>I-D</strong>), weight maintenance in obese women during pregnancy (<strong>III-D</strong>), antihypertensive therapy specifically to prevent preeclampsia (<strong>I-D</strong>), and vitamins C and E. (<strong>I-E</strong>) </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation about the usefulness of the following: the heart-healthy diet (<strong>III-L</strong>); exercise (<strong>I-L</strong>); selenium (<strong>I-L</strong>); garlic (<strong>I-L</strong>); zinc, pyridoxine, iron (with or without folate), vitamin D, or multivitamins with/without micronutrients.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The Appendix (see Table 10 in the full version of the original guideline document [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]) lists tools to support the application of this guideline. Some Web sites provide general information about blood pressure (BP) measurement for non-pregnant patients, but the recommendations are similar enough to those for pregnant women to be useful. Patients, their partners, and their care providers should be well educated about the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), and relevant sites are listed.</p>
<p>Implementation of any evidence depends on individual knowledge and beliefs, as well as institutional culture. Strong recommendations should be incorporated into clinical practice. In well-resourced settings, almost all preeclampsia-related maternal deaths involve substandard care.</p>
<p>Some updates to the 2008 Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) guidelines on the HDP may require additional effort to implement.</p>
<p>Physicians should consider the category &quot;other HDP&quot; (white-coat and masked hypertension) as part of the classification of hypertensive women and consider using some form of out-of-office BP measurement to evaluate women with non-severe pre-existing or gestational hypertension.</p>
<p>Health care providers should inform pregnant women about the symptoms and signs of the HDPs and refer them to appropriate knowledge translation tools.</p>
<p>The developer recommends the use of corticosteroids for women &amp;le; 34+6 weeks' gestation who are at high risk of delivery within the next seven days. This gestational age cut-off represents a fundamental change in practice that will require discussion.</p>
<p>Physicians should be familiar with the blood bank policies of their own hospital.</p>
<p>Physicians should be aware of postpartum signs of maternal posttraumatic stress disorder and the maternal and perinatal long-term effects of HDPs, especially at this vulnerable time in maternal care when the maternity care provider is often handing back care to the primary care physician.</p>
<p>The reader is reminded to refer to the full open-access guideline published in Pregnancy Hypertension, which contains not only the recommendations presented here, but also all explanatory text and additional references.</p></div>"/>
