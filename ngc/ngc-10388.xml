These new timing recommendations, which can decrease the risk of epidural or spinal hematoma, will be added to the labels of anticoagulant drugs known as low molecular weight heparins, including Lovenox and generic enoxaparin products and similar products. </li>

<p><strong>Investigation and Management</strong></p>
<p>Patients with MGUS <span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>do not require any treatment</strong></span> unless they have evidence of organ or tissue impairment (i.e., CRAB or ROTI) and thus should be classified as symptomatic myeloma rather than MGUS. Patients with MGUS are at risk to develop lymphoproliferative diseases such as myeloma, amyloidosis or malignant lymphomas. They should be re-examined annually.</p>
<p>At <em>diagnosis</em> the following tests should be completed:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Complete blood count (CBC) </li>
    <li>Creatinine </li>
    <li>Ca </li>
    <li>Total protein </li>
    <li>Albumin </li>
    <li>Quantitative immunoglobulin levels (IgG, immunoglobulin A [IgA], immunoglobulin M [IgM]) </li>
    <li>Serum and urine (24-hour collection) protein electrophoresis </li>
    <li>FLC studies </li>
    <li>Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy </li>
    <li>Skeletal survey </li>
</ul>
<p>The following tests should be obtained <em>yearly</em> thereafter:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>CBC </li>

<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<p>No treatment is required unless progression to multiple myeloma or other lymphoproliferative disorder. Patients should be followed every 3 to 4 months and monitored for &quot;myeloma-related&quot; symptoms (CRAB) or organ damage.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Multiple Myeloma</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Diagnostic Criteria</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>M-protein in serum and/or urine as detected by serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), UPEP, or FLC </li>
    <li>Clonal bone marrow PC or plasmacytoma </li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Staging</strong></p>
<p>The Alberta Provincial Hematology Tumour Team as the standard staging system has adopted the International Staging System, rather than Durie-Salmon, for myeloma patients (see Tables 1 and 2 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>Initial Investigations</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>History and physical exam </li>
    <li>CBC, albumin, total protein, creatinine, &amp;beta;2-microglobulin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), calcium, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin (bili) </li>

    <li>Cytogenetics (tests in <strong>bold font</strong> are required and strongly recommended at diagnosis):
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li><strong>Fluorescence <em>in situ</em> Hybridization (FISH)</strong> for:
        <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>

            <li>1q21 amplification; t(14;20) (not available through Calgary Lab Services) </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Conventional band karyotyping at diagnosis</strong>. To indicate ploidy status and presence of del13q. Full karyotyping not required. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>MRI may be indicated in special circumstances (i.e., to rule out cord compression, central nervous system [CNS] involvement, non-secretory multiple myeloma and solitary bone or soft tissue plasmacytoma). </li>
    <li>PET scan is not currently indicated for the diagnosis or follow-up of multiple myeloma patients. </li>
    <li>Echocardiogram or cardiac MRI is only indicated if there is clinical suspicion of cardiac amyloidosis. </li>
</ul>
<p>Myeloma-associated amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis is reported in 12% to 30% of multiple myeloma patients. These patients typically fulfill the diagnostic criteria for multiple myeloma and have evidence of AL deposition confirmed by Congo red staining. The presence of AL amyloidosis should be suspected in the presence of nephrotic range proteinuria with predominant albuminuria; non-hypertensive congestive heart failure without coronary artery disease; low voltage, bradycardia or atrio-ventricular (AV) block on electrocardiogram (EKG), organomegaly, autonomic neuropathy, and carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>
<p>The following investigations should be ordered if the diagnosis of myeloma-associated AL amyloidosis is suspected in order to confirm the diagnosis:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Congo red staining of the bone marrow </li>
    <li>Fat pad aspirate and Congo red staining if bone marrow is negative </li>
    <li>Direct biopsy of suspected involved organ if Congo red stain is negative in bone marrow and fat pad </li>
    <li>Congo red positive biopsies should be forwarded for mass spectroscopy analysis and typing </li>
</ul>
<p>Patients with biopsy-proven amyloidosis should be classified as &quot;Myeloma with Documented Amyloidosis&quot; if they have &amp;ge;10% plasma cells and/or myeloma-related bone disease. For the management of these patients, please refer to &quot;Amyloidosis&quot; below.</p>
<p><strong>Prognosis</strong></p>
<p>Prognostic information reflects the treatment received during the era of a specific publication and may not reflect improvements in outcome expected with the introduction of novel agents, triple induction therapy, maintenance, consolidation, etc. (refer to Tables 3 and 4 in the original guideline document for statistics on survival outcomes).</p>
<p><em>Flow Cytometry</em></p>
<p>Flow cytometry should be performed on bone marrow biopsies at diagnosis, and on subsequent biopsies in order to confirm complete remission. The presence or absence of immunophenotyic evidence of clonal plasma cells on bone marrow samples following therapy is a strong predictor of progression-free survival (PFS) and survival.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment Guidelines for Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma</strong></p>
<p><em>Goals of Therapy</em></p>
<p>The goals of therapy for young patients with multiple myeloma is to achieve the deepest possible response, ideally a complete remission, and to then maintain that response for as long as possible.</p>
<p>For elderly patients, the goal of therapy is to minimize symptoms and maximize response with as little toxicity as possible.</p>
<p>These guidelines identify effective, evidence-based treatment regimens (as opposed to single agents) to be utilized. These treatment regimens can include multi-drug and multi-step approaches, radiation therapy, or single agents when appropriate.</p>
<p><em>Patients &amp;le;65 Years Old and Transplant-Eligible</em></p>
<p>Whenever possible, patients should be considered for a clinical trial. In the absence of a suitable trial, patients who are 65 years old or younger and are transplant-eligible, induction with a 3-drug regimen that includes a novel agent, followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), is standard initial therapy.</p>
<p>For information about specific induction regimens, including bortezomib-based, thalidomide-based, and lenalidomide-based regimens; stem cell transplantation; and post-transplant therapy, see the original guideline document.</p>
<p><em>Summary</em></p>
<p>Regimens containing bortezomib and dexamethasone as well as a third agent (cyclophosphamide, lenalidomide) are the standard induction regimen prior to stem cell transplantation for transplant eligible patients with standard-risk or high-risk myeloma requiring treatment. Vincristine-doxorubicin-dexamethasone (VAD) or single-agent dexamethasone should not be used.</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Cyclophosphamide-bortezomib-dexamethasone (CYBORD) is the recommended regimen for initial therapy of newly diagnosed transplant eligible patients. Patients should receive 4&amp;ndash;6 cycles prior to stem cell collection. Cycles are repeated every 28 days. A twice-weekly schedule can be used for sicker patients requiring a more rapid initial response to therapy. </li>
    <li>High-risk patients (17p deletion, t(4;14)) should be considered for initial therapy with a combination of bortezomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (VRD). </li>
    <li>Patients refractory to bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone (VCD; fail to achieve at least partial response [PR]) should be switched to second line therapy with lenalidomide and dexamethasone or VRD (bortezomib days 1, 4, 8, and 11, lenalidomide days 1&amp;ndash;14, weekly dexamethasone) for several cycles prior to stem cell mobilization. </li>
    <li>Cyclophosphamide 2.5 G/m<sup>2</sup> followed by growth factor administration is used for stem cell collection. </li>
    <li>The standard stem cell transplant regimen consists of a single transplant conditioned with high-dose (200 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) melphalan </li>
    <li>Following transplant:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Standard-risk patients achieving very good partial response (VGPR) or better should receive lenalidomide (25 mg daily for 21/28 days) plus dexamethasone (40 mg weekly) for 3 months followed by lenalidomide (10 mg daily) for 2 years. </li>
        <li>Standard-risk patients who fail to achieve VGPR post-transplant should receive 2&amp;ndash;4 cycles of VRD followed by lenalidomide (10 mg) daily for 2 years. </li>
        <li>High-risk patients should receive 2&amp;ndash;4 cycles of VRD followed by lenalidomide (10 mg daily) for 2 years. Patients with 17p deletion should also receive bortezomib (1.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) every 2 weeks for 2 years. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Patients &amp;gt;65 Years Old or Transplant Ineligible</em></p>
<p>Whenever possible, patients should be considered for a clinical trial. In the absence of a suitable trial, combinations of melphalan and prednisone with novel agents (thalidomide, lenalidomide, or bortezomib) have been shown to be superior to melphalan and prednisone alone as initial therapy for transplant ineligible patients. The standard therapy for these patients should therefore include a novel agent, alkylator, and steroids. However, in frail patients, and those with significant co-morbidities or advanced age (&amp;gt;75 years), there is an increased risk of toxicities. For these patients, consideration should be given to dose reductions of the initial regimen, and/or the use of 2-drug combinations such as lenalidomide and dexamethasone (RD) or bortezomib and dexamethasone (VD).</p>
<p>For information about specific induction regimens, including thalidomide-based, bortezomib-based, and lenalidomide-based regimens, see the original guideline document.</p>
<p><em>Summary</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>CYBORD for 6&amp;ndash;12 cycles is the recommended therapy for newly-diagnosed, transplant-ineligible patients. </li>
    <li>Alternatively, patients may be treated with bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone (VMP) for 6 cycles. </li>
    <li>Following initial therapy, all patients should receive maintenance with bortezomib 1.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 every 3 months plus prednisone 50 mg every other day (VP). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatment Guidelines for Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma</strong></p>
<p>Whenever possible, patients with relapsed multiple myeloma should be considered for a clinical trial. In the absence of a suitable trial, treatment of relapsed disease should be determined on individual basis depending on timing of relapse, age, prior therapy, bone marrow function, co-morbidities, and patient preference.</p>
<p><em>Autologous Stem Cell Transplant</em></p>
<p>A second high-dose chemotherapy treatment with autologous stem cell transplantation for those patients who have had a disease free interval of &amp;gt;2 years following their initial high-dose therapy is a reasonable consideration. The median time to progression after a salvage second autologous stem cell transplant is typically less than 1 year and the transplant-related mortality (TRM) varies between 4% and 14%. When a patient with relapsed myeloma is being considered for a salvage second transplant, the TRM and the activity of novel agents should be clearly discussed and reviewed with the patient.</p>
<p><em>Novel Drugs</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Several classes of drugs such as immunomodulatory drugs (IMIDs) (thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide) and proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, carfilzomib), either as single agents or combination with other drugs (dexamethasone, prednisone, melphalan, cyclophosphamide), have been shown to be active in the treatment of relapsed and refractory myeloma. Table 10 in Appendix A in the original guideline document summarizes the results of randomized phase III trials in relapsed and refractory myeloma. </li>
    <li>The choice of the first line of salvage therapy is mostly guided by the preference of the patient and the treating physician with a particular consideration made for enrolment into a clinical trial. The following guidelines however should be taken into account when a salvage therapy is considered:
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
        <li><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Renal failure</span>: Lenalidomide dose adjustment is required for patients in renal failure or on hemodialysis in order to minimize the risk of cytopenia. No such adjustment is required for bortezomib. </li>
        <li><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Peripheral neuropathy</span>: Bortezomib is clearly neurotoxic and should not be the first choice of salvage therapy in patients with grade 2 sensory neuropathy or grade 1 with pain. </li>
        <li><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Prior exposure to thalidomide</span>: Prior exposure to thalidomide does not preclude patients from responding to lenalidomide. While a shorter time to progression (TTP) was reported in the MM009 and MM010 studies in patients previously exposed to thalidomide, their modified TTP (mTTP) was 8.6 months. </li>
        <li><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Prior history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)</span>: IMIDs are known to have a prothrombotic effect. Risk of thrombosis with thalidomide and lenalidomide varies between 10% and 15% and can be as high as 25% when these drugs are used with erythropoietin. Prophylaxis of DVT with aspirin or therapeutic Coumadin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is mandatory. Bortezomib is the agent of choice over IMIDs for patients with prior life-threatening thrombotic events. If IMIDs are to be used, patients should receive prophylactic LMWH. </li>
        <li><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Distance from hospital</span>: IMIDs offer the advantage of being orally administered and therefore require less frequent visits to the hospital. Nevertheless, in non-compliant patients bortezomib is preferable. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Assessment of Response to Therapy</em></p>
<p>The response criteria and disease progression/relapse criteria of the International Myeloma Working Group, shown in Tables 7 and 8 in the original guideline document, have been adopted to assess response to therapy, progression, and other survival parameters.</p>
<p>As part of response assessment, all patients should have a repeat bone marrow aspirate at the time of maximum response.</p>
<p><strong>Follow-up after Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Myeloma patients <span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>should not</strong></span> be discharged from the Cancer Centre as they are rarely cured of their disease. Patients should be seen at intervals varying from 1 to 3 months depending on their disease status, and whether they are receiving monthly pamidronate. Each visit should include:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>A clinical assessment </li>
    <li>CBC, electrophoresis, creatinine, Ca, albumin, total protein, quantitative immunoglobulins, and measurement of M-protein (SPEP <strong>and</strong> UPEP) </li>
    <li>FLC studies are also required in patients with non-measurable disease, oligo-secretory and light-chain disease. </li>
    <li>IFE on SPEP and UPEP and bone marrow biopsy are required to confirm complete response (CR). </li>
    <li>FLC is required to confirm stringent CR (sCR). </li>
    <li>A skeletal survey should be obtained once per year. </li>
</ul>
<p>The recommended follow-up plan as outlined by the International Response Criteria includes:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Patients undergoing therapy should be tracked monthly for the first year of new therapy and every other month thereafter. </li>
    <li>Patients with &quot;measurable disease&quot; need to be followed by both SPEP and UPEP for response assessment and categorization. </li>
    <li>Except for assessment of CR, patients with measurable disease restricted to the SPEP will need to be followed only by SPEP; correspondingly, patients with measurable disease restricted to the UPEP will need to be followed only by UPEP. </li>
    <li>Patients with measurable disease in either SPEP or UPEP or both will be assessed for response only based on these two tests and not by the FLC assay. FLC response criteria are only applicable to patients without measurable disease in the serum or urine, and to fulfill the requirements of the category of sCR. </li>
    <li>To be considered CR, both serum and urine IFE must be carried out and be negative regardless of the size of baseline M-protein in the serum or urine; patients with negative UPEP values pre-treatment still require UPEP testing to confirm CR and exclude light-chain or Bence-Jones escape. </li>
    <li>A skeletal survey is not required for assessment of response unless clinically indicated, but is recommended once a year in clinical practice. </li>
    <li>Bone marrow is required for categorization of CR, and for patients with non-secretory disease. Bone marrow aspirate should be performed at the time of maximum response to therapy. </li>
</ul>
<p>For information about supportive therapy, including bisphosphonates, osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), and percutaneous vertebral augmentation or kyphoplasty, see the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Solitary Plasmacytoma</span></strong></p>
<p>The location of the solitary plasmacytoma is crucial to predicting its natural history. The majority of patients with extra-osseous (non-bone-involving) plasmacytoma have localized disease which is potentially curable with irradiation. <em>The majority of patients with solitary plasmacytoma of bone will eventually manifest overt multiple myeloma</em> (&amp;gt;50% will progress to multiple myeloma).</p>
<p><strong>Solitary Plasmacytoma of Bone</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Typically no M-protein in serum/urine (a small M-component is present in 50%) </li>
    <li>Single area of bone destruction due to clonal PC </li>
    <li>Bone marrow not consistent with multiple myeloma </li>
    <li>Normal skeletal survey (and MRI of spine and pelvis if done) </li>
    <li>No CRAB or ROTI (no end organ damage other than solitary bone lesion) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Extramedullary Plasmacytoma</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Typically no M-protein in serum/urine (a small M-component is present in 50%) </li>
    <li>Extramedullary tumour of clonal PC </li>
    <li>Normal bone marrow </li>
    <li>Normal skeletal survey </li>
    <li>No CRAB or ROTI (no end-organ damage including bone lesions) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Staging</strong></p>
<p>Patients should undergo all the usual tests for multiple myeloma. CT scan of the plasmacytoma should be obtained prior to radiation therapy. An MRI of the spine and pelvis may show unsuspected and asymptomatic skeletal lesions. This finding would place the patient in the smoldering myeloma category. PET scan could help determine the extent of bone or soft tissue involvement.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment and Prognosis</strong></p>
<p><em>Solitary Plasmacytoma of Bone</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Treatment consists of radiation in the range of 40 Gy&amp;ndash;50 Gy. </li>
    <li>Solitary plasmacytomas &amp;gt;5 cm, the persistence of an M-protein after radiation or evidence or marrow involvement by MRI have a greater incidence of progression. </li>
    <li>50% of patients with solitary plasmacytoma are alive at 10 years. </li>
    <li>25% to 40% of patients survive disease-free at 10 years. </li>
    <li><em>Overt multiple myeloma occurs in almost 50% of patients</em> with solitary plasmacytoma of bone (progression may occur 15 years later). </li>
    <li>Recommend stem cell harvest in transplant-eligible patients. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Extramedullary Plasmacytoma</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Treatment with localized radiation (40 Gy&amp;ndash;50 Gy) and is often curative. </li>
    <li>Plasmacytoma may recur locally or metastasize to regional nodes. </li>
    <li><em>Symptomatic multiple myeloma occurs in only 15% of patients.</em> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Follow-up</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>CBC, serum creatinine, Ca, and SPEP should be done every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months for 2 years, then annually. </li>
    <li>A 24-hr UPEP and skeletal survey should be done annually, for at least 5 years for extra-osseous plasmacytomas, and for 5&amp;ndash;10 years for osseous plasmacytomas. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Amyloidosis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Classification</strong></p>
<p>The systemic amyloidosis can be divided into 3 major subtypes (refer to Table 12 in the original guideline document).</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Primary (also called AL type) -- most common subtype with 90% involving lambda light chain </li>
    <li>Familial transthyretin-associated (ATTR type) </li>
    <li>Secondary (AA type) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Diagnostic Pathway for AL Amyloidosis</strong></p>
<p>Consider AL amyloidosis in the differential if there is evidence of:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Non-diabetic nephrotic syndrome </li>
    <li>Cardiomyopathy non-ischemic: echo shows &quot;left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)&quot; </li>
    <li>Hepatomegaly with no scan defects </li>
    <li>Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy </li>
    <li>&quot;Atypical myeloma&quot; urine light-chain + and marrow &amp;lt;10% plasma cells </li>
</ul>
<p>Amyloidosis remains a tissue diagnosis. Tissue biopsy, either of an involved organ or a surrogate site (e.g., abdominal fat), must demonstrate amyloid deposition by classic Congo red staining or electron microscopy. Since MGUS is not an uncommon finding, especially in patients with advanced age, the presence of a monoclonal protein in a patient with positive Congo red staining on a tissue biopsy is not adequate to make a diagnosis of AL amyloidosis. In addition, some patients with AL amyloidosis will not have an abnormal SPEP or FLC assay. Immunohistochemical staining is frequently unreliable and not able to accurately determine the type of amyloid present. Therefore laser microdissection with mass spectrometry (LMD/MS) is now the gold standard for typing amyloid, enabling precise identification of type in over 98% of cases.</p>
<p><em>Initial Tests</em></p>

<p><strong>Treatment Guidelines for AL Amyloidosis</strong></p>
<p>Most hematological responses will result in clinical improvement of some degree even up to 12 months after the hematological responses have been recorded. The goal of the therapy is to halt the production of the amyloid protein (hematological remission, response criteria below). It should be noted that the treatment of an amyloidosis patient is multidisciplinary and requires the active involvement of a nephrologist and cardiologist.</p>
<p><em>Bortezomib-based Regimens</em></p>
<p>In the absence of grade 2 neuropathy or grade 1 neuropathy with pain, bortezomib-based regimen should be considered first line of therapy:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The standard initial therapy for amyloidosis is CyBorD (bortezomib 1.5 mg/m<sup>2</sup> weekly, cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m<sup>2</sup> orally weekly, and dexamethasone 40 mg weekly). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Melphalan plus Dexamethasone</em></p>
<p>Treatment with melphalan and dexamethasone remains the &quot;gold standard&quot; therapy for AL amyloidosis. The recommended treatment regimen is melphalan 10 mg/m<sup>2</sup> days 1 to 4 plus high-dose oral dexamethasone (40 mg per day on days 1&amp;ndash;4) for up to 18 treatment courses if no severe adverse effects have occurred.</p>
<p><em>Autologous Stem Cell Transplant</em></p>
<p>Only one randomized trial of autologous stem cell transplant versus melphalan plus dexamethasone was conducted and failed to show any difference in event-free survival (EFS) or overall survival (OS) between these 2 treatments. This study was however likely underpowered to detect a difference in survival between the treatment arms. Several other non-randomized studies did report high response rates with prolonged survival compared to matched-cases treated with melphalan plus dexamethasone. Stem cell transplantation should ideally be conducted only in the setting of a clinical trial, or for highly motivated patients who do not have poor prognosis disease (severe heart disease or &amp;ge;3 organs involved) and in a center experienced with this procedure.</p>
<p>When stem cell transplantation is performed, the following guidelines should be followed:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Patients should be &amp;lt;65 years old, have &amp;lt;3 major organs involved, and no congestive heart failure. </li>
    <li>Three risk categories according to Comenzo and Gertz are as follows:
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
        <li>Good risk patients are of any age and have 1 to 2 organs involved, no cardiac involvement and creatinine clearance &amp;gt;50 mL/min. </li>
        <li>Intermediate risk patients are &amp;lt;71 years old and have 1 to 2 organs involved, one of which must include cardiac or renal with creatinine clearance &amp;lt;51 mL/min. </li>
        <li>Poor risk patients have either three organs involved or advanced cardiac involvement. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Stem cell mobilization with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone (5&amp;ndash;6 &amp;mu;g/kg q12 hours for 5 days). </li>
    <li>Debulking with VAD or other regimens pre-transplant is unnecessary and not recommended. </li>
    <li>Conditioning with dose melphalan (140&amp;ndash;200 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) adjusted according to number of organ involved and the degree of heart failure. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Novel Agents (Thalidomide, Lenalidomide)</em></p>
<p>Several phase I/ II studies have been reported using one of these novel agents; however their therapeutic effect was limited by their toxicity. Table 11 in Appendix A in the original guideline document summarizes some of these studies.</p>
<p><strong>Supportive Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Supportive care is a fundamental part of an integrated treatment approach to AL amyloidosis patients and requires the coordinated expertise of several specialists. Table 14 in the original guideline document summarizes the recommended supportive measures.</p>
<p><strong>Response Criteria and Disease Monitoring</strong></p>
<p>The goal of therapy is a complete hematologic response. In patients with significant comorbidities or treatment related side effects, a 90% reduction in involved free light chains (iFLC) is likely a reasonable target. Failure to achieve a 50% reduction in the iFLC has been associated with significantly shortened survival.</p>
<p><em>Hematologic (Immunochemical) Response</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Complete response</span>: serum and urine negative for a monoclonal protein by means of IFE, normal kappa:lambda FLC ratio, and normal absolute value of the involved serum FLC (in patients without renal insufficiency). </li>
    <li><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Partial response</span>: serum M component &amp;gt;0.5 g/dL and 50% reduction; light chain in the urine with a visible peak &amp;gt;100 mg/day and 50% reduction; or FLC &amp;gt;10 mg/dL and 50% reduction. </li>
    <li><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Progression after complete response</span>: any detectable monoclonal protein or abnormal FLC ratio (light chain must double). </li>
    <li><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Progression after partial response or stable response</span>: 50% increase in serum M-protein to &amp;gt;0.5 g/dL or 50% increase in urinary M-protein to &amp;gt;200 mg/day with a visible peak. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Organ Response</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Heart</span>: mean interventricular septal thickness decreased by 2 mm, 20% improvement in EF, improvement by 2 New York Heart Association classes without an increase in diuretic use, and no increase in wall thickness </li>
    <li><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Kidney</span>: 50% decrease (a decrease of at least 0.5 g/day) in 24-hr urinary protein (must be &amp;gt;0.5 g/day before treatment), creatinine and creatinine clearance must not worsen by 25% over baseline level </li>
    <li><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Liver</span>: 50% decrease in abnormal ALP value, at least 2 cm decrease in liver size on radiographic imaging </li>
    <li><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Nerve</span>: improvement in nerve conduction velocity on electromyogram (rare) </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Disease Monitoring</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Patients who are being actively treated should be monitored monthly for treatment-related toxicities (e.g., cytopenia, nausea). In addition, assessment of their organ involvement (e.g., heart failure, renal dysfunction, neuropathy) should be performed. Response to therapy should also be monitored on a monthly basis while actively treated, and every 8 to 10 weeks thereafter. Recommended laboratory tests include:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>CBC, electrolytes, creatinine, ALP </li>
        <li>SPEP, 24-hr UPEP, FLC studies </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In addition, EKG and echocardiogram should be assessed every 6 months. Other investigations such as nerve conduction studies and abdominal ultrasounds will need to be repeated only if there is evidence of organ involvement at baseline and for the evaluation of response to therapy. </li>

<p>When the draft guideline document has been completed, revised, and reviewed by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist and the working group members, it is sent to all members of the Provincial Tumour Team for review and comment. This step ensures that those intended to use the guideline have the opportunity to review the document and identify potential difficulties for implementation before the guideline is finalized. Depending on the size of the document, and the number of people it is sent to for review, a deadline of one to two weeks will usually be given to submit any feedback. Ideally, this review will occur prior to the annual Provincial Tumour Team meeting, and a discussion of the proposed edits will take place at the meeting. The working group members will then make final revisions to the document based on the received feedback, as appropriate. Once the guideline is finalized, it will be officially endorsed by the Provincial Tumour Team Lead and the Executive Director of Provincial Tumour Programs.</p></div>"/>

    <li>The vincristine-doxorubicin-dexamethasone (VAD) regimen should not be used to the toxicity of this regimen (neurotoxicity, cardiac toxicity, myelosuppression) and its inferior outcomes compared to bortezomib containing regimens. </li>
    <li>Patients who are being actively treated should be monitored monthly for treatment-related toxicities (e.g. cytopenia, nausea). In addition, assessment of their organ involvement (e.g., heart failure, renal dysfunction, neuropathy) should be performed. Response to therapy should also be monitored on a monthly basis while actively treated, and every 8 to 10 weeks thereafter. </li>
    <li>Randomized controlled trials of thalidomide have demonstrated higher incidence of adverse events with thalidomide as compared to standard therapy. In particular, venous thromboembolism (VTE), peripheral neuropathy, and constipation are increased. Risk of VTE (between 4% and 20%) is greater when thalidomide is combined with steroid and/or chemotherapy but less when thalidomide used as maintenance. </li>
    <li>When therapy is started in elderly patients, frail patients, the very elderly (over 75 years of age) and those with significant co-morbidities are at an increased risk of toxicity from combination regimens. As a result of such toxicity, therapy is often terminated early resulting in poorer outcomes than if less intense but more tolerable therapy were to be given for a longer period of time. </li>
    <li>Risk of thrombosis with thalidomide and lenalidomide varies between 10% and 15% and can be as high as 25% when these drugs are used with erythropoietin. </li>
    <li>Lenalidomide dose adjustment is required for patients in renal failure or on hemodialysis in order to minimize the risk of cytopenia. No such adjustment is required for bortezomib. </li>
    <li>Bortezomib is clearly neurotoxic and should not be the first choice of salvage therapy in patients with grade 2 sensory neuropathy or grade 1 with pain. </li>
