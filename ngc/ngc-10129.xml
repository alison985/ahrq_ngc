<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Assessment of Sleep Disorders</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - In a general assessment of children in Primary Care (PC) Health Centers, a medical history that includes the following is recommended: a description of sleep over a 24-hour period, the age of onset, incorrect sleep habits (schedules), behaviour, school performance, evaluation of the day (not just the night), family medical history of sleep disorders, if this is an acute or <strong><em>chronic</em></strong> temporary disorder, other biological functions that are affected, the use of medicines and drugs and the presence of other pathologies and/or syndromes.</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - The use of <strong><em>key questions</em></strong> is recommended for detecting sleep disorders and to be able to discard other disorders (see Appendix 2 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - Percentiles curves for sleep duration can be used to help see the evolution of a child's sleep and for a comparison thereof with other children (see Appendix 2 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - The use of a sleep-wake diary/log for at least 15 days is recommended in order to know the patient's sleep and wake times and to monitor the evolution thereof (see Appendix 5 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - If sleep-related breathing disorders, parasomnias, rhythmic movements and/or periodic limb movements are suspected, a home video-recording is recommended for the assessment thereof.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - As a screening tool for sleep problems, the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) is recommended for infants under the age of 2 and a half (see Appendix 6 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - As a screening tool of sleep problems in children from 2 to 18 years of age, the use of the BEARS questionnaire is recommended (B = Bedtime Issues, E = Excessive Daytime Sleepiness, A = Night Awakenings, R = Regularity and Duration of Sleep, S = Snoring) (see Appendix 6 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - To assess the presence of sleep disorders in school age, the use of Bruni's Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC) questionnaire is recommended (see Appendix 6 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - The schematic presented in Appendix 7 in the original guideline document is recommended for handling sleep problems/disorders in PC paediatric consultations using the aforementioned questionnaires.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Preventive Strategies for Sleep Disorders</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - The characteristic aspects of sleep according to age ranges should be taken into account to be able to establish preventive recommendations (see Table 11 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - Parents, caretakers and/or adolescents should be informed about the preventive strategies of sleep problems during visits to Primary Care Health Centers according to the corresponding age (see Appendix 8.1 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - It is recommendable that educators keep in mind a series of preventive strategies of sleep problems to be able to adequately handle and inform parents/caretakers and/or adolescents, depending on the corresponding education-learning cycle (see Appendix 8.2 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>The Child Who Has Trouble Falling Asleep</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Insomnia</strong></p>
<p><em>Diagnosis</em></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - The diagnosis should be made basically through a medical record, and sometimes with the help of the information gathered by the family in sleep-wake diaries/logs.</p>
<p><em>Treatment</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Sleep Hygiene Strategies</span></p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - Educational interventions that include sleep hygiene practices are recommended, in addition to information about the importance of and need for sleep (see Appendixes 8 and 9 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Psychological Interventions*</span></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Techniques based on the principles of behavioral therapy (BT) for insomnia should at least include graduated extinction, after parent education. Other behavioral therapies that can be recommended are unmodified extinction, delaying bedtime in conjunction with the pre-sleep ritual and scheduled awakenings.</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - Before recommending the graduated extinction technique, it is recommendable to assess the parent's tolerance to this technique, for which a series of questions can help (see Appendix 12 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - For adolescents, sleep hygiene practices and behavioral interventions that at least include stimulus control is recommended for treating insomnia. Another intervention that could be recommended is cognitive restructuring.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - For adolescents, sleep education and management programmes are recommended, including guidelines on sleep hygiene practices, instructions on stimulus control and information about consuming substances and the impact that sleep problems can have on mood and academic performance.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - To reduce cognitive activation prior to sleep in adolescents who have insomnia and a tendency to think about their problems when it's time to go to bed, a structured problem-solving procedure is recommended.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*Appendix 11 in the original guideline document includes information for PC professionals and for parents, caretakers and adolescents about the main interventions.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Pharmacological Interventions</span></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - The pharmacological treatment of paediatric insomnia requires a careful selection of patients, after having made the correct diagnosis according to the professional's judgement.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Pharmacological treatment is not recommended either as a first option or as an exclusive treatment strategy for paediatric insomnia.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - The use of drugs must be preceded by the application of sleep hygiene practices.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Pharmacological treatment is always recommended in combination with non-pharmacological strategies such as behavioral interventions and parent education.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Medication should only be used in the short term, and the drug should be selected according to the problem&amp;mdash;short action for sleep onset problems and with a long half-life for maintenance problems&amp;mdash;thereafter monitoring the benefits and adverse effects.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Prior to starting the use of drugs, clear treatment objectives should be established together with the parents/caretakers or adolescents, and the use of other medicines, alcohol, drugs and the possibility of pregnancy should be explored.</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - Pharmacological treatment of paediatric insomnia is recommended when:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The safety or welfare of the child is threatened. </li>
    <li>The parents are unable to implement non-pharmacological interventions. </li>
    <li>The insomnia is within the context of a medical illness or an acute stressor situation. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D</strong> - The pharmacological treatment of paediatric insomnia is not recommended when:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>There is an untreated, sleep-disorder breathing. </li>
    <li>The insomnia is due to a developmentally based normal sleep behavior or due to false expectations of the parents about sleep. </li>
    <li>The insomnia is due to a short duration, self-limited condition (e.g., teething). </li>
    <li>There may be potential drug interactions with the usual medication or with substance or alcohol abuse. </li>
    <li>It is not possible to follow up on and/or monitor the treatment (parents are incapable of going to scheduled appointments). </li>
</ul>
<p>Melatonin</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - There is no evidence for recommending the use of melatonin in children under 6 years of age.</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - The Spanish Agency of Medicines and Healthcare Products (AEMPS) has not authorised melatonin for paediatric insomnia. However, the outcomes obtained from trials in children between 6 and 12 years of age who have chronic sleep onset insomnia and who do not respond to educational interventions with sleep hygiene practices and psychological interventions suggest that once approved, the use of melatonin at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg, administered at least 1 to 2 hours before the desired bedtime, could be assessed.</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - Melatonin must be chemically pure and always be administered at the same time and under adequate control by a paediatrician or a doctor specialising in sleep disorders, and the removal thereof should be assessed according to the clinical evolution. If, for any reason (forgotten, holiday, etc.), it cannot be administered at that time, the dose for that day should be eliminated.</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - Professionals are advised to ask parents about any type of melatonin acquired at a store or health food store to avoid the use of melatonin of animal origin and/or uncontrolled doses.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Other Treatments</span></p>
<p>Nutritional Supplements</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - More long-term comparative studies are needed to give a general recommendation for using nutritional supplements to treat paediatric insomnia.</p>
<p>Medicinal Herbs</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of valerian or the use of valerian in combination with hops for treating paediatric insomnia.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Professionals are advised to ask parents/adolescents about any health food store product that is being taken or that may have been taken in order to alert them about the danger of self-medication in combination with drugs and herbal products.</p>
<p>White Noise</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - There is insufficient evidence about efficacy and safety to recommend the use of white noise for treating paediatric insomnia.</p>
<p><strong>Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)</strong></p>
<p><em>Diagnosis</em></p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - RLS should fundamentally be diagnosed through a complete medical record that includes personal and family medical history, a comprehensive physical examination and a haematological study (blood count, blood sugar, transaminases, kidney function, iron metabolism). The information gathered by families in sleep logs/diaries can be useful.</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - It is advisable to keep in mind the following pathologies when posing a differential diagnosis: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), positional discomfort, growth pains, motor ticks, muscle pains, muscle cramps, bone pathology, acathisia and other illnesses such as skin diseases, rheumatic illnesses, peripheral polyneuropathy, radiculopathy or muscular dystrophy, hypnic myoclonus, myoclonic crises and parasomnias.</p>
<p><em>Treatment</em></p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - In less serious cases of RLS, a series of general, non-pharmacological strategies are recommended, which include reducing or eliminating those factors that bring on RLS (limiting the consumption of caffeine, chocolate, nicotine, alcohol and drugs) and applying rules based on the principles of sleep hygiene practices, mainly, and recommendations to relatives about adequate sleep schedules for their children, depending on the age.</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - To reduce discomfort in legs in class at school, family and school support is recommended, which can translate into strategies such as allowing the child to leave to take a walk during class, some physical activity during breaks or frequently changing positions.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - More evidence is needed to make a general recommendation about physical exercise programmes for treating paediatric RLS.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - The measurement of iron and ferritin levels in the blood is recommended if RLS symptoms are present, even when there is no anaemia or there is moderate anaemia.</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - In the event that the serum ferritin levels are below 35 &amp;mu;g/l, oral treatment with iron is recommended, at a therapeutic dose of iron-deficiency anaemia, followed by subsequent analytical control.</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - It is advisable that children with RLS who do not respond to the general strategies, to sleep hygiene practices or to the oral intake of iron be referred to secondary care or Hospital Care.</p>
<p><strong>Delayed Sleep-Phase Syndrome (DSPS)</strong></p>
<p><em>Diagnosis</em></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - DSPS must be diagnosed by clinical evaluation, for which sleep diaries/logs with information collected by families can be used if it is suspected.</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - It is advisable to take into account the following for a differential diagnosis: both primary and secondary insomnia, inadequate sleep hygiene practices and some mood or anxiety disorders.</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - Basic sleep hygiene practices are recommended for reducing factors that precipitate DSPS (see Appendix 8 in the original guideline document), with emphasis on the following: avoiding naps, understanding that the bed is for sleeping (and not for eating, studying, listening to music, talking on the phone, etc.), avoiding physical activity close to bedtime and avoiding excessive exposure to light (from the TV, computer, video games or other devices) at the end of the day and increasing exposure to natural light in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - More evidence is needed to make a general recommendation for phototherapy or bright light for the treatment of DSPS in children.</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - AEMPS has not authorised melatonin for DSPS in children, although the outcomes of trials on children over 6 years of age who have the delayed sleep-phase syndrome and who do not respond to sleep hygiene interventions suggest that, once approved, the use thereof could be assessed at a dose in the 0.3-6 mg range, up to 6 hours before the usual bedtime.</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - Melatonin must always be administered under adequate control by a paediatrician or a doctor specialising in sleep disorders, and the removal thereof should be assessed according to the clinical evolution.</p>
<p><strong>B, C</strong> - More evidence is needed to recommend chronotherapy for the treatment of DSPS in children.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - The administration of vitamin B12 for the treatment of DSPS in children is not recommended.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>The Child Who Has Abnormal Events at Night</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS)</strong></p>
<p><em>Diagnosis</em></p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - The diagnosis of suspected OSAHS in primary care health centers must be initiated according to adequate medical history and a physical examination (see Table 21 in the original guideline document), initially including three key questions (see Table 23 in the original guideline document) and paying attention to warning signs and symptoms (see Table 22 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Chervin's Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (reduced PSQ) is recommended for helping to establish the diagnosis of suspected obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) (see Appendix 6 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - In addition, a home video-recording could be requested, which can be assessed using Sivan's videotape recording score to help with the diagnostic suspicion (see Appendix 6 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - In the event of the confirmed clinical suspicion of OSAHS, it is advisable to refer the patient to secondary care or hospital care (see Chapter 9, algorithm 4 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><em>Treatment</em></p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - As treatment for OSAHS in primary care health centers, a conservative treatment is recommended (sleep hygiene strategies, see Appendix 8 in the original guideline document) until definitive treatment is established at a secondary care or Hospital Care and after the treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - Clinical re-assessment and follow-up after treatment of children with OSAHS are recommended upon return to primary care health centers after having been treated in hospital care. Children should be sent back to hospital care under certain circumstances (see Chapter 9, algorithm 4 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>Sleepwalking, Night or Sleep Terrors and Confusional Arousals</strong></p>
<p><em>Diagnosis</em></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - A complete medical record should be drawn up, including a detailed description of the episodes, with special emphasis on the age of onset, the time when it occurs, the frequency, the regularity and duration of the episodes, any family medical history of sleep disorders and factors associated with predisposition or precipitation of episodes, as well as the impact that the disorder is causing to the patient's daily life.</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - In addition to a physical examination, it is recommendable to complete the medical history with an assessment of development and an assessment of behaviour in the social, family and school environments.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - It is advisable to keep in mind the following pathologies when posing a differential diagnosis: rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder, nightmares, nocturnal panic attacks and nocturnal epilepsy (nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy).</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - It is advisable to use the Frontal Lobe Epilepsy and Parasomnias (FLEP) scale in the event that there might be diagnostic doubts between frontal lobe epilepsy and parasomnias (Appendix 6 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - It is recommendable to refer patients to a unit specialising in sleep disorders or to centres of reference if they show symptoms suggesting unusual or atypical parasomnias (due to the age of onset, the time when the episodes occur, the frequency, the regularity and duration of the episodes and the motor patterns), if another sleep disorder is suspected as the trigger (obstructive sleep apnea syndrome or periodic leg movements), in cases when legal considerations may require it or when there is no response to conventional treatment.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Cases in which it is suspected that a sleep disorder may be related to epileptic crises should be referred to a unit specialising in sleep disorders or to a secondary care or hospital care. This is also true for assessing sleep-related behaviours that are violent or potentially dangerous to the patient or others.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Referring cases of typical parasomnias that are not complicated or that have not caused injuries to a unit specialising in sleep disorders or to a secondary care or Hospital Care is not recommended.</p>
<p><em>Treatment</em></p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - It is recommendable to discuss the generally benign and self-limiting nature of the episodes with the parents of an affected child.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - The first measure that should be taken is to improve sleep hygiene practices: the child must sleep enough hours, naps should not be eliminated if they are usually taken, a regular sleep schedule should be maintained and possible triggers should be avoided.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Parents should be advised about how to act when an episode occurs: lead the child back to bed, avoid waking them up and interfering and avoid discussing the episode the following day.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - It is recommendable to advise parents about the appropriate safety practices that should be taken at home.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - When episodes are not successfully managed using sleep hygiene practices, the attempt can be made to control them by scheduled awakenings if the episodes usually occur at approximately the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - In more serious or intense cases, or cases that have consequences for wakefulness or that have not responded to the preceding practices, the patient should be referred to a secondary care or hospital care.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - If there is evidence of a primary sleep disorder (OSAHS, restless leg syndrome with periodic limb movement disorder [RLS-PLM]) or other comorbid disorders (ADHD), these disorders should be treated to correct the parasomnias.</p>
<p><strong>Nightmares</strong></p>
<p><em>Diagnosis</em></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - The diagnosis should be made fundamentally through the medical record, with the help of sleep logs/diaries.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - A polysomnography is not recommended routinely for diagnosing nightmares.</p>
<p><em>Treatment</em></p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - It is recommendable to put the family at ease, thereby insisting on the benign and limited nature of the symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - The following actions are recommended to prevent the appearance of nightmares: maintaining good sleep hygiene strategies (see Appendix 8 in the original guideline document); maintaining a calm and relaxed period before going to bed; avoiding watching horror films or television series or listening to horror stories before going to bed; reducing those factors that can be stressful to the child; restricting the intake of liquids after dinner; and having the child urinate before going to bed.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - When a child has a nightmare, it is recommendable that the parents use any or several of the following strategies: soothing and calming the child, emphasising that it has only been a nightmare, or using objects that transmit security to the child to help them go back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - It is recommendable to ask the child, depending on their age, to draw or describe the nightmare with the help of the parents, thereby changing the ending of the same so that the child feels secure with this new ending.</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - Whenever nightmares occur almost every night or there are several episodes in the same night, or there is a risk that the subject might become injured or injure others or when the nightmares affect the activities of daily life, the child should be referred to a secondary care or hospital care.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep-Related Rhythmic Movement Disorder</strong></p>
<p><em>Diagnosis</em></p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - The diagnosis must be made fundamentally through the medical record, a physical examination, sleep logs/ diaries and, sometimes, with the help of home videos-recording by the family.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - A video-polysomnography must be reserved for cases in which the diagnosis is doubtful, when other sleep disorders coexist (such as OSAHS) and when it is necessary to determine how the movements affect sleep quality or daily activities.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - The differential diagnosis of sleep-related rhythmic movement disorders should include developmental disorders, medical disorders (neurological, pain, gastroesophageal reflux, ear infection, blindness or others), self-stimulating behaviours, convulsions and other parasomnias and movement disorders (bruxism, sleep spasms, tics, spasmus nutans, REM sleep behaviour disorder or RLS-PLMD).</p>
<p><em>Treatment</em></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - As the first measure, it is recommendable to put the family at ease, thereby insisting on the benign and limited nature of the symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Parents should be instructed about the safety practices for preventing a child from injuring himself: tightening the screws on a crib, placing bumpers in cribs and placing protective bars on beds.</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - In more serious or intense cases, or cases that have consequences on wake times or that persist beyond six years of age, the patient should be referred to a secondary care or hospital care.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>The Child Who Falls Asleep During the Day</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS)</strong></p>
<p><em>Diagnosis</em></p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - EDS should be fundamentally diagnosed through a complete medical record that includes the medical background, any medicines or drugs that are being taken and the patient's habits, in addition to any daily consequences using the help of information gathered by families in sleep logs/diaries and the Paediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS).</p>
<p><strong>Narcolepsy</strong></p>
<p><em>Diagnosis</em></p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - To help with the diagnosis of narcolepsy, it is necessary to investigate if there is a family medical history of other causes of EDS or of narcolepsy.</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - Diagnostic tests targeted at confirming or discarding this disorder must be performed at a hospital, preferably at a secondary care or hospital care.</p>
<p><em>Treatment</em></p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - Parents/guardians should be advised to inform schools about the needs of children so that their schedules and school work can be adapted according to their needs, without affecting their academic performance.</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - Children should receive supervision when they perform potentially dangerous activities (such as swimming).</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - Adolescents who are diagnosed with narcolepsy and who have driver's licenses will be advised not to drive and to notify their status to the Department of Motor Vehicles. They will also be informed about legislation in force, which states that persons with narcolepsy may not obtain or extend a driver's license, unless a favourable medical report is issued, in which case the validity period of the license can be reduced according to the physician's opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - Sleep hygiene strategies must be explained, thereby insisting on education about healthy habits (see Appendix 8 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - It is recommendable to take a short, scheduled nap throughout the day.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Information for the Patient/Relatives of the Patient</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - It is recommendable to provide information to the parents/caretakers and children/adolescents who have sleep problems (or who are suspected of having them), thereby including general information about the problem and about effective interventions (see Appendix 15 in the original guideline document&amp;ndash; information for the patient).</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - To improve adherence to treatment and facilitate shared decision-making, the experiences, preferences and expectations of the parents/caretakers and children/adolescents regarding the therapeutic decisions to be made must be taken into account.</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - It is recommendable to help parents/caretakers and children/adolescents acquire a certain degree of motivation to carry out a health professional's recommendations regarding sleep hygiene strategies and psychological interventions that require behaviour modification.</p>
<p><strong>Good clinical practice point</strong> - Parents/caretakers and children/adolescents must be made aware of the barriers that can arise and the effort involved in complying with certain psychological interventions regarding the adoption of new patterns of behaviour (keeping the same sleep times every day, getting out of bed until becoming sleepy again, eliminating certain habits that can alter sleep behaviour [such as playing video games], foods/drinks with caffeine, eating chocolate, etc.).</p>

In the short term, some secondary effects have been found, such as headaches, dizziness, sensation of cold and nighttime worsening of asthma. There have also been warnings about the possibility that the use of high doses of melatonin, in the long term, might inhibit ovulation and reproductive functions in puberty due to its action on the melatonin receptors distributed in the ovaries and suprarenal glands. There have also been warnings about the variability of the quality of the preparations, given that some coming from health food stores may contain harmful contaminants of animal origin. </li>
    <li>In the long term, there is one follow-up study on some of the children previously included in one of the aforementioned randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

<p>Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are useful for improving the quality of care for and outcomes in patients. The great challenge today is to get professionals to adhere to them. An implementation strategy directed at overcoming the barriers that exist in the environment where they are going to be applied is fundamental.</p>
<p>The plan for implementing the<em> Clinical Practice Guideline for Managing Patients with Sleep Disorders in Childhood and Adolescence in Primary Care Health Centers</em> includes the following interventions:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Presentation of the guideline to the media by health authorities. </li>
    <li>Presentation of the guideline to the directorates and sub-directorates of primary care (PC) health centers and hospital care of the various regional health services. </li>
    <li>Institutional presentation of the guideline, in cooperation with the Quality Agency of the Ministry of Health, Social Policy and Equality, to the various scientific societies, patient associations and professionals involved. </li>
    <li>The informative material prepared for the patient will be highlighted in all presentations, thereby favouring distribution of the material among all health professionals and, in turn, among parents/caretakers and children/adolescents with this health problem. </li>
    <li>Effective distribution directed at the professional groups involved (paediatricians, family physician, nurses and social workers in PC; child neurologists, psychiatrists, neurophysiologists, psychologists, respiratory specialists and otolaryngologists) to facilitate dissemination. </li>
    <li>Interactive presentation of the guideline at health centres by local opinion leaders. </li>
    <li>Distribution of the guideline in electronic format on the web pages of the Ministry of Health, Social Policy and Equality; of GUIASALUD; of the Health Technology Evaluation Unit (UETS); and of the scientific societies and patient associations involved in the project. </li>
    <li>Publication of the guideline in scientific journals. </li>
    <li>The establishment of good care criteria for a child/adolescent with sleep problems in programme contracts and clinical management contracts, as it is established in the guideline. </li>
    <li>Evaluation of the effectiveness of implementation by establishing support systems for clinical decisions, thereby integrating the guideline and the indicators selected in the computer programme used in PC health centers. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Proposal of Indicators</strong></p>
<p>A series of indicators have been designed, which it must be possible to measure through the information system in PC health centers, for the purpose of evaluating both the healthcare given to a paediatric patient (and their parents/caretakers) who has suffered from a sleep problem/disorder and the possible impact from having implemented the guideline. The purpose has not been to design a comprehensive and detailed evaluation that involves using all the proposed indicators.</p>
<p>The intention is to provide a tool for any interested clinics and managers, which can be useful for specifically designing an evaluation of the care given to paediatric patients with sleep disorders in PC health centers.</p>
<p>Two types of indicators are proposed:</p>
