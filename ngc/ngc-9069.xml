<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Conclusions</span></strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Phenytoin possibly reduces lopinavir and ritonavir levels by about 30% (1 Class II study). </li>
    <li>Valproic acid possibly increases zidovudine exposure (1 Class II study). </li>
    <li>Valproic acid possibly has no effect on efavirenz exposure (1 Class II study). </li>
    <li>Ritonavir/atazanavir possibly reduces lamotrigine exposure by about 30% (1 Class II study). </li>
    <li>Raltegravir and atazanavir possibly have no effect on lamotrigine exposure (1 Class II study). </li>
    <li>Raltegravir possibly has no effect on midazolam exposure (1 Class II study). </li>
    <li>The evidence is insufficient to support or refute other pharmacokinetic antiepileptic drug (AED)-antiretroviral agent (ARV) interactions (single Class III/multiple Class IV studies). </li>
    <li>Coadministration of highly active antiretroviral therapy containing a protease inhibitor (PI) or nonnucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and an enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug (EI-AED) possibly results in higher virologic failure rates (1 Class II study). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Patients receiving phenytoin may require a lopinavir/ritonavir dosage increase of about 50% to maintain unchanged serum concentrations (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Patients receiving valproic acid may require a zidovudine dosage reduction to maintain unchanged serum zidovudine concentrations (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Coadministration of valproic acid and efavirenz may not require efavirenz dosage adjustment (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Patients receiving ritonavir/atazanavir may require a lamotrigine dosage increase of about 50% to maintain unchanged lamotrigine serum concentrations (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Coadministration of raltegravir or atazanavir and lamotrigine may not require lamotrigine dosage adjustment (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Coadministration of raltegravir and midazolam may not require midazolam dosage adjustment (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Patients may be counseled that it is unclear whether dosage adjustment is necessary when other AEDs and ARVs are combined (<strong>Level U</strong>). </li>
    <li>It may be important to avoid EI-AEDs in people on ARV regimens that include PIs or&amp;nbsp;NNRTIs, as pharmacokinetic interactions may result in virologic failure, which has clinical implications for disease progression and development of ARV resistance. If such regimens are required for seizure control, patients may be monitored through pharmacokinetic assessments to ensure efficacy of the ARV regimen (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Context</span></strong></p>
<p>A retrospective cohort study and numerous pharmacokinetic studies indicate that EI-AEDs interact with ARVs. The optimal choice of epilepsy treatment in patients with HIV should reflect an accounting for the metabolic and inhibitory/inducing profiles of coadministered drugs. Clinicians who prescribe ARVs and AEDs are encouraged to refer to the Department of Health and Human Services treatment guidelines for HIV/AIDS, which provide specific recommendations for the management of possible drug&amp;ndash;drug interactions with AED-ARV combinations (available at <a href=&quot;http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines/&quot; title=&quot;AIDSinfo Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines/</a>). For newer ARV agents, minimal data exist on drug interactions with AEDs.</p>

<p><strong>Classification of Evidence for Rating of a Therapeutic Article</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong> = A randomized, controlled clinical trial of the intervention of interest with masked or objective outcome assessment, in a representative population. Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences.

    <li>Primary outcome(s) clearly defined </li>
    <li>Exclusion/inclusion criteria clearly defined </li>
    <li>Adequate accounting for drop-outs (with at least 80% of enrolled subjects completing the study) and cross-overs with numbers sufficiently low to have minimal potential for bias </li>
    <li>For non-inferiority or equivalence trials claiming to prove efficacy for one or both drugs, the following are also required*:
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
        <li>The authors explicitly state the clinically meaningful difference to be excluded by defining the threshold for equivalence or non-inferiority. </li>
        <li>The standard treatment used in the study is substantially similar to that used in previous studies establishing efficacy of the standard treatment (e.g., for a drug, the mode of administration, dose and dosage adjustments are similar to those previously shown to be effective). </li>

<p><strong>Class II</strong> = A randomized controlled clinical trial of the intervention of interest in a representative population with masked or objective outcome assessment that lacks one criteria a&amp;ndash;e above or a prospective matched cohort study with masked or objective outcome assessment in a representative population that meets b&amp;ndash;e above. Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences.</p>

<p><strong>Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>To estimate the worldwide prevalence of potential co-usage of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and antiretroviral agent (ARVs), a literature search (1950 to April 2008, updated 2010) without language restrictions was conducted using MEDLINE, Cochrane Database, Web of Science, and EMBASE and the following strategy: [prevalence or incidence or epidemiology or comorbid] and [HIV or AIDS] and [neuropathy or seizure or epilepsy]. Given the prevalence of HIV-associated neuropathies in low-income countries and use of AEDs to treat neuropathic pain, neuropathy was included in the search. Because of the dearth of data and the potential clinical value of this information regarding specific AED-ARV combinations, details from case reports and uncontrolled series are provided in the evidence and summary tables.</p>
<p>To determine potential drug&amp;ndash;drug interactions between AEDs and ARVs, a comprehensive list of AEDs and ARVs was developed (see table e-1 on the Neurology&amp;reg; Web site at <a href=&quot;http://www.neurology.org&quot; title=&quot;AAN Web site&quot;>www.neurology.org</a>; note that investigational drugs as of April 2008 were not included). Using this list, the panel performed the following search (1950 &amp;ndash;2010): drug interaction and [antiepileptic or anticonvulsant or AED or {AED from table e-1}] and [antiretroviral or ARV or ART or {ARV from table e-1 of the original guideline appendices}]. The authors' literature files were also hand-searched for potentially relevant articles.</p>
<p><strong>Literature Review</strong></p>
<p>The broad search yielded 4,480 articles with potential data (1,146 on co-usage of AEDs and ARVs; 3,334 on AED-ARV drug&amp;ndash; drug interactions). At least 2 panelists reviewed the resulting articles' titles and abstracts. Additional publications identified during review of selected articles were also obtained. The full article of any abstract deemed relevant was reviewed. At least 2 panelists independently reviewed 68 full articles. Of these, 42 articles were used for data abstraction using the elements listed below for each question. Where data abstraction findings from the 2 panel reviewers differed, a third panelist reviewed the primary source. Data are presented in tables e-2 and e-3. The original and updated search strategies are provided in appendices e-1 and e-2.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>2014 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>MEDLINE was searched from January 2010 to April 2014 using the following terms: HIV, Antiepileptic Drugs. Inclusion/exclusion criteria for the search were RCTs, humans only, relevant to clinical questions; criteria used to screen search results were the same as described in the 2012 published guideline.</p></div>"/>

<p>Given the topic's global relevance, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Quality Standards Subcommittee formed a joint panel with the International League Against Epilepsy via the World Health Organization (WHO). The AAN guideline development processes are consistent with those required by WHO.</p>
<p>The panel asked the following questions: In people treated with antiretrovirals (ARVs) for human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) who also have conditions requiring antiepileptic drug (AED) use, does concurrent treatment with AEDs and ARVs lead to drug interactions? If so, are these interactions clinically meaningful? The panel also performed a systematic literature review to estimate the worldwide prevalence of potential co-usage of AEDs and ARVs.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>2014 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>A Guideline Development, Dissemination, and Implementation (GDDI) member who had expertise in epilepsy conducted a targeted literature search for high quality studies using the same criteria as presented in the original guideline. The GDDI reviewer and the subcommittee reviewed the new evidence and determined that the following three criteria were met: 1. There is no new evidence that would alter conclusions or recommendations in the guideline since the last literature search, 2. Guideline methodology is sound and current methodology is not substantially different, and 3. No significant practice variation relevant to the guideline currently exists.</p></div>"/>

Use of AEDs that decrease ARV levels (e.g., the enzyme-inducing AEDs [EI-AEDs] phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine) may lead to virologic failure, resulting in immunologic decline, clinical disease progression, and development of ARV resistance. Because first-line AED availability in most low- and middle-income countries is limited to phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, and ARV regimen options may also be limited, there is substantial risk for occurrence of clinically important drug interactions.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is committed to producing independent, critical and truthful clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Significant efforts are made to minimize the potential for conflicts of interest to influence the recommendations of this CPG. To the extent possible, the AAN keeps separate those who have a financial stake in the success or failure of the products appraised in the CPGs and the developers of the guidelines. Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee prior to project initiation. AAN limits the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest. The AAN forbids commercial participation in, or funding of, guideline projects.
