	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Summary of Literature Review</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction/Background</strong></p>
<p>It is estimated that as many as 170,000 cancer patients per year will develop brain metastases. Brain metastases represent the most common neurologic manifestation of cancer, occurring in about 30% of cancer patients, particularly those with lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma, who account for up to 64%, 21%, and 16%, respectively, of patients with brain metastases.</p>
<p>Clinical, imaging, and autopsy series have shown that about half of brain metastases will be single and half will be multiple. Solitary metastatic disease refers to 1 metastasis to the brain in the setting of <em>no other</em> extracranial metastatic disease. Single (or singular) metastatic disease refers to 1 metastasis in the brain in the setting of metastatic disease elsewhere in the body. The term &quot;multiple metastases&quot; refers to more than 1 lesion in the brain, with some clinicians distinguishing fewer than 4 metastases as being more favorable than 4 or greater. Among patients with multiple lesions, 70% are supratentorial, 26% are supratentorial and cerebellar, 3% are cerebellar, and 1% are located in the brainstem. The most common symptoms of brain metastases are headache, altered mental status, and focal weakness, occurring in about one-third to one-half of patients. The next most common symptoms include seizures and gait ataxia, which are seen in about 10% to 20% of patients.</p>
<p>Historically, whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) has been a standard of care in patients with multiple brain metastases, although there have been no randomized trials showing that it offers a survival advantage over supportive care. Of interest, the QUARTZ (Quality of Life After Treatment for Brain Metastases) trial is an ongoing UK Medical Research Council phase III multicenter study assessing whether optimal supportive care alone (including dexamethasone) is as effective as optimal supportive care including dexamethasone plus WBRT for patients with inoperable brain metastases from non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Numerous prospective randomized trials have looked at ways to improve outcomes in patients with multiple brain metastases, including the use of different dose/fractionation schedules, radiation sensitizers, chemotherapy, surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and are the focus of the present review.</p>
<p><strong>Prognostic Factors</strong></p>
<p>The median survival time of a patient with brain metastases following WBRT is in the 4- to 6-month range. Certain clinical prognostic factors are associated with a better or worse outcome. The most commonly used prognostic system is the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group&amp;reg; (RTOG&amp;reg;) recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) classification. On the basis of this analysis, patients younger than age 65 whose Karnofsky performance status (KPS) is &amp;ge;70 and who have a controlled primary cancer without other systemic metastases have a median survival time of 7.1 months. Those with a KPS &amp;lt;70, independent of other factors, have a median survival time of 2.3 months, whereas all other patients have a 4.2 month median survival time. A group of researchers proposed a new prognostic index for brain metastases patients. They compared it to three other indices &amp;mdash; including the RTOG RPA classification &amp;mdash; and found it to be the least subjective and most quantitative. In a subsequent analysis, researchers retrospectively analyzed 5,067 brain metastases patients and found that prognosis factors varied by diagnosis, and this resulted in a disease-specific classification of outcomes. Out of these data, these authors generated the Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA), a prognostic index for patients with brain metastases to create diagnosis-specific GPA indices. The authors recently updated these diagnosis-specific GPA indices into a single, unified, user-friendly schema to allow ease of access and use by treating physicians when making clinical decisions for their brain metastases patients. Thus, for any given tumor type, clinicians may make more accurate survival predictions using relevant tumor-specific prognostic criteria to aid in better treatment selection. These factors include cancer type (lung [non-small, small], gastrointestinal, breast, renal, melanoma); presence of extracranial metastases; estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status (for primary breast cancer); KPS; and number of brain metastases [1, 2-3, &amp;gt;3]. Imaging-based prognostic factors, such as presence of midline shift and post WBRT response, may also influence outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Whole Brain Radiation Therapy</strong></p>
<p>A variety of total doses and doses per fraction have been used in prospective, randomized phase III clinical trials, primarily in patients with multiple brain metastases. These regimens include 1000 cGy in 1 fraction (1000/1), 1200/2, 1800/3, 2000/5, 3000/10, 3000/15, 3600/6, 4000/15, 4000/20, 4000/20 (200 cGy twice a day [BID]), 5000/20, and 5440/34 (160 cGy BID). While none of these regimens has proven better than another in terms of survival or efficacy (about half of patients have an improvement in their neurologic symptoms), 3000 cGy in 10 fractions and 3750 cGy in 15 fractions represent the most frequently used dose/fractionation schedules in the United States.</p>
<p>In selecting treatment regimens appropriate for individual patients, clinicians should consider the RTOG RPA brain metastasis classification, which supports short-course treatment in poor risk patients (i.e., poor performance status, elderly, progressive systemic disease). (See Variant 1 above.)</p>
<p><strong>Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy and Neurocognitive Function</strong></p>
<p>Neurocognitive morbidity from WBRT remains a potential concern but is poorly understood. For example, in a contemporary trial for patients with 1 to 3 brain metastases carried out by the RTOG, 3750 cGy in 15 fractions WBRT (i.e., 250 cGy per fraction) was used as the standard treatment arm based on concerns regarding late effects from a historical retrospective series suggesting that a regimen of 300 cGy fractions given after resection of a solitary brain metastasis was associated with a greater likelihood of late effects to the normal brain. However, this 1989 retrospective report of dementia in 12 patients with long survival has been highly criticized for its reported radiation total doses and fractionation schemes. Contemporary WBRT trials have been more appropriately designed to better understand the neurologic status of patients with multiple brain metastases and in defining the safety and appropriateness of conventional WBRT in their care. (See Variant 2.)</p>
<p>Some studies, for example RTOG 9104, have used the mini-mental status exam (MMSE) to measure neurologic impairment, with no differences found in terms of neurologic performance between the arms at baseline or on follow-up. A group of researchers used the MMSE for neurocognitive assessment of the patients in their randomized trial of SRS versus WBRT plus SRS and found time to neurocognitive deterioration was marginally prolonged in those receiving WBRT plus SRS. However, many authors consider the MMSE a relatively insensitive test. Neurocognitive function (NCF) with a neuropsychometric battery before and after WBRT (3000 cGy in 10 fractions) was assessed prospectively in a phase III trial of WBRT with or without motexafin gadolinium (MGd). Impairment was found in &amp;gt;90% of patients at baseline, and the results suggested that only tumor control correlated with NCF, suggesting a potential benefit if WBRT conveys more tumor control. Further substantiating the neurocognitive benefits of WBRT was an analysis of the 208 patients in the control arm of this trial, which looked at the relationship between NCF and tumor volume regression. Another group of authors found that WBRT-induced tumor shrinkage correlated with better survival and NCF preservation. NCF was found to be stable or improved in long-term survivors, and tumor progression, more than WBRT dose, adversely affected NCF.</p>
<p>Researchers conducted a phase III trial of SRS compared to SRS plus WBRT for patients with 1 to 3 brain metastases; the primary endpoint was a change in neurocognitive function at 4 months as measured by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT). They found that patients treated with SRS plus WBRT had a significant impairment in learning and memory function by HVTL compared to patients treated with SRS alone. This study, however, has been controversial based on unexpected survival differences favoring the SRS arm and for the timing of the neurocognitive assessment to one time point.</p>
<p>Though it is common for patients with multiple brain metastases to have active primary and other systemic metastatic disease, progression of brain disease is the cause of death in about half of these patients (range, 26% to 70%).</p>
<p>In view of these concerns regarding WBRT and its potentially detrimental effect on long-term cognitive performance, various strategies aimed at preventing such decline are now being investigated. The RTOG 0614 recently published the results of a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial to evaluate the potential protective effect of memantine on neurocognitive function in patients receiving WBRT. Memantine is a neuroreceptor antagonist drug used in dementia patients that has been shown to be neuroprotective in preclinical models. The study accrued 554 patients, and its results showed that there was less of a decline in delayed recall testing in the memantine arm at 24 weeks (P=.059) compared to placebo, but the difference was not statistically significant. Overall, patients treated with memantine appeared to have better cognitive function over time; specifically, memantine delayed time to cognitive decline and reduced the rate of decline in memory, executive function, and processing speed in patients receiving WBRT. Optimal use of this drug based on patient performance and diagnosis remains under investigation. With respect to WBRT radiation delivery, there has been interest in the use of modern technology to spare the hippocampus during the cranial irradiation, since damage to neural progenitor cells located in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus is associated with radiation-induced neurocognitive decline. Although not formally published yet, a recently completed RTOG phase II study (#0933) was designed to be hippocampal-sparing and measured changes in delayed recall compared to historical controls as its primary endpoint. This approach remains investigational.</p>
<p><strong>Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy and Drug Therapies</strong></p>
<p>Various radiation sensitizers have been added to WBRT without a demonstrated improvement in survival, including lonidamine, misonidazole, bromodeoxyuridine, and the nitrosourea 1-(4-amino-2-methyl-5-pyrimidinyl) methyl-3-(2-chloroethyl) 3-nitrosourea hydrochloride (ACNU), either alone or with fluorouracil. The addition of biological modifiers such as efaproxiral and MGd has not demonstrated survival benefits. A subgroup analysis of the interval to investigator-determined neurologic progression and the interval to neurocognitive progression suggested a trend towards prolongation of time to neurological progression with the early use of MGd, but this finding was not demonstrated in the overall study population. Phase III studies with biological agents melatonin and thalidomide likewise showed no improvement in overall survival. Phase III studies with biological agents melatonin and thalidomide likewise showed no improvement in overall survival. RTOG 0320, a phase III trial, randomized NSCLC patients with 1 to 3 brain metastases to the addition of temozolomide or erlotinib with WBRT plus SRS and found no improvement in survival and a possible deleterious effect of the drugs.</p>
<p>Overall, there is no strong evidence to date to support the use of any radiation sensitizer or biologic agent in standard practice. The routine use of chemotherapy in the setting of WBRT has not been shown to increase survival in any randomized trial to date, including studies of WBRT with or without concurrent chemotherapy, chemotherapy with or without concurrent WBRT, concurrent versus delayed WBRT, and chemotherapy followed by WBRT versus WBRT followed by chemotherapy.</p>
<p><strong>Surgery and Stereotactic Radiosurgery</strong></p>
<p>Surgery has not had a major role in the management of patients with multiple brain metastases. Some retrospective studies have suggested that it can offer a survival benefit, but its role is controversial. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) phase III trial (22952-26001) of the addition of adjuvant WBRT after surgery or radiosurgery of one to three brain metastases showed that WBRT reduced local relapse and neurologic death but did not improve the duration of functional independence or overall survival. Health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) results were subsequently reported for this trial. Overall, patients in the observation-only arm reported better HRQOL scores than did patients who received WBRT, and the authors concluded that observation with close monitoring of patients with limited brain disease by MRI is not detrimental for HRQOL.</p>
<p>One study used the RTOG&amp;reg; RPA brain metastasis classification to analyze the results of tumor resection and radiosurgery in the management of 52 patients with multiple brain metastases and found that RPA classification correlates best with improved survival. Another study investigated the role of surgery in the treatment of 138 patients with multiple brain metastases when performed with radiation therapy. Median survival times were 8.7 months for patients with single metastases and 9.2 months for those with multiple metastases (no significant difference).</p>
<p>A group of researchers reported a small randomized trial in which 27 patients with 2 to 4 brain metastases &amp;le;25 mm in diameter received WBRT alone or with an SRS boost. Local control at 1 year was 92% with SRS versus 0% without SRS. Median survival time was also better with SRS (11 months versus [vs] 7.5 months).</p>
<p>RTOG&amp;reg; 9508 was a phase III trial in which 333 patients with 1 to 3 brain metastases were randomized to WBRT with or without SRS boost. The overall median survival with the addition of SRS was 6.5 months vs 5.7 months, a nonsignificant difference. The trial included a predefined analysis of patients with a single brain metastasis, which showed a survival advantage with the addition of SRS to WBRT for these patients (median survival time 6.5 months vs 4.9 months, <em>P</em>=0.0393) but not for patients with multiple metastases. Post-hoc subset analysis suggested a survival benefit with the addition of SRS for RTOG RPA class 1 patients and those with squamous NSCLC histology. Additionally, an improved KPS and decreasing need for steroids were noted in patients treated with WBRT plus SRS, suggesting a role for SRS in select patients with 2 to 3 brain metastases. (See Variant 3 above.)</p>
<p>Another group of researchers published a study of 132 patients with 1 to 4 brain metastases randomized to SRS plus WBRT versus SRS alone. Median survival times were 7.5 months for the SRS alone arm and 8.0 months for the SRS plus WBRT arm, a nonsignificant difference. Of interest, intracranial relapse occurred more frequently in those who did not receive WBRT. These results suggest the value of WBRT in patients with multiple brain metastases and the influence of patient selection on the effectiveness of SRS. Given the finding that SRS does not increase survival of patients with 2 or more brain metastases, clinicians need to practice careful selection of patients for this intervention. The RTOG&amp;reg; RPA brain metastasis classification may prove useful in making this selection. (See Variant 4 above.)</p>
<p>A phase III neurocognition trial of SRS compared to SRS plus WBRT for patients with 1 to 3 brain metastases reported a significant decline in learning and memory function at 4 months in the WBRT arm compared with the SRS arm. The results of this trial, which was stopped after accruing 58 patients based on early stopping rules, remain controversial and found that the median survival time and the 1-year survival rate was higher for the SRS-alone group than for patients in the SRS plus WBRT group (15.2 vs 5.7 months, 63% vs 21%; P=0.003). Some authors suggest the survival advantage in the SRS group is due to an imbalance in the prognostic factors between the arms and differences in salvage therapy, favoring the SRS arm. (See Variant 5 above.)</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>WBRT is an effective palliative treatment for patients with multiple brain metastases. About half of these patients experience an improvement in their neurologic symptoms. However, a majority of them do not achieve local control and frequently succumb from progressive brain disease. </li>
    <li>Stratification of brain metastases patients using prognostic indices aids in estimation of patient survival and appropriate decision making for treatment. </li>
    <li>Any perceived benefits from surgery or SRS need verification in prospective, randomized phase III clinical trials. </li>
    <li>The effectiveness of SRS for patients with multiple metastases may be primarily a function of proper patient selection, but it probably cannot replace the benefits of WBRT for the majority of patients with multiple brain metastases. </li>
    <li>Continued research with radiation sensitizers, biologics, targeted agents, or systemic agents is warranted, because WBRT alone, even in doses of 5000 to 5440 cGy, has not been associated with an improved survival outcome. </li>
    <li>Future trials of WBRT must include prospective measurement of neurocognitive function and quality of life before and after treatment as a standard component of the patient's assessment. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Rating Appropriateness</strong></p>
<p>The appropriateness ratings for each of the procedures included in the Appropriateness Criteria topics are determined using a modified Delphi methodology. A series of surveys are conducted to elicit each panelist's expert interpretation of the evidence, based on the available data, regarding the appropriateness of an imaging or therapeutic procedure for a specific clinical scenario. American College of Radiology (ACR) staff distribute surveys to the panelists along with the evidence table and narrative. Each panelist interprets the available evidence and rates each procedure. The surveys are completed by panelists without consulting other panelists. The appropriateness rating scale is an ordinal scale that uses integers from 1 to 9 grouped into three categories: 1, 2, or 3 are in the category &quot;usually not appropriate&quot;; 4, 5, or 6 are in the category &quot;may be appropriate&quot;; and 7, 8, or 9 are in the category &quot;usually appropriate.&quot; Each panel member assigns one rating for each procedure for a clinical scenario. The ratings assigned by each panel member are presented in a table displaying the frequency distribution of the ratings without identifying which members provided any particular rating.</p>
<p>If consensus is reached, the median rating is assigned as the panel's final recommendation/rating. Consensus is defined as eighty percent (80%) agreement within a rating category. A maximum of three rounds may be conducted to reach consensus. Consensus among the panel members must be achieved to determine the final rating for each procedure.</p>
<p>If consensus is not reached, the panel is convened by conference call. The strengths and weaknesses of each imaging procedure that has not reached consensus are discussed and a final rating is proposed. If the panelists on the call agree, the rating is proposed as the panel's consensus. The document is circulated to all the panelists to make the final determination. If consensus cannot be reached on the call or when the document is circulated, &quot;No consensus&quot; appears in the rating column and the reasons for this decision are added to the comment sections.</p>
<p>This modified Delphi method enables each panelist to express individual interpretations of the evidence and his or her expert opinion without excessive influence from fellow panelists in a simple, standardized and economical process. A more detailed explanation of the complete process can be found in additional methodology documents found on the <a href=&quot;http://www.acr.org/ac&quot; title=&quot;ACR Web site&quot;>ACR Web site</a> (see also the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The American College of Radiology (ACR) Committee on Appropriateness Criteria and its expert panels have developed criteria for determining appropriate imaging examinations for diagnosis and treatment of specified medical condition(s). These criteria are intended to guide radiologists, radiation oncologists, and referring physicians in making decisions regarding radiologic imaging and treatment. Generally, the complexity and severity of a patient's clinical condition should dictate the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Only those examinations generally used for evaluation of the patient's condition are ranked. Other imaging studies necessary to evaluate other co-existent diseases or other medical consequences of this condition are not considered in this document. The availability of equipment or personnel may influence the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Imaging techniques classified as investigational by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have not been considered in developing these criteria; however, study of new equipment and applications should be encouraged. The ultimate decision regarding the appropriateness of any specific radiologic examination or treatment must be made by the referring physician and radiologist in light of all the circumstances presented in an individual examination.</p></div>"/>
