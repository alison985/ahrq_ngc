	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) grades its recommendations (A, B, C, D, or I) and identifies the levels of certainty regarding net benefit (High, Moderate, and Low). The definitions of these grades can be found at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Summary of Recommendation and Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The USPSTF recommends screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in persons at high risk for infection. (<strong>B recommendation</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Patient Population Under Consideration</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic, nonpregnant adolescents and adults at high risk for HBV infection (including those at high risk who were vaccinated before being screened for HBV infection).</p>
<p><strong>Assessment of Risk</strong></p>
<p>A major risk factor for HBV infection is country of origin. The risk for HBV infection varies substantially by country of origin in foreign-born persons in the United States. Persons born in countries with a prevalence of HBV infection of 2% or greater account for 47% to 95% of those with chronic HBV infection in the United States (see Table 1 in the original guideline document). Another important risk factor for HBV infection is lack of vaccination in infancy in U.S.-born persons with parents from a country or region with high prevalence (&amp;ge;8%), such as sub-Saharan Africa, central and Southeast Asia, and China (see Figure 2 in the original guideline document). Because the prevalence of HBV infection may gradually change over time, it is important to note that some countries and regions with prevalence rates between 5% and 7% are considered to be highly endemic areas.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) uses a prevalence threshold of 2% or greater to define countries with high risk for HBV infection. Because this threshold is substantially higher than the estimated prevalence of HBV infection in the general U.S. population (0.3% to 0.5%), it is a reasonable threshold for deciding to screen a patient population or risk group. Additional risk groups for HBV infection with a prevalence of 2% or greater that should be screened include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive persons, injection drug users, household contacts or sexual partners of persons with HBV infection, and men who have sex with men (see Table 2 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>The CDC also recommends screening in persons receiving hemodialysis or cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy (for example, chemotherapy for malignant diseases, immunosuppression related to organ transplantation, and for rheumatologic and gastroenterologic disorders).</p>
<p>Some persons with combinations of risk factors who are not members of one of these risk factor groups may also be at increased risk for HBV infection. However, reliable information about combinations of risk factors is not available. Clinicians should exercise their judgment in deciding whether these persons are at sufficiently high risk to warrant screening. For example, screening is probably appropriate in settings that treat a large proportion of persons at increased risk, such as clinics for sexually transmitted infections; HIV testing and treatment centers; health care settings that provide services for injection drug users or men who have sex with men; correctional facilities; and institutions that serve populations from countries with a high prevalence of infection, including community health centers.</p>
<p>The prevalence of HBV infection is low in the general U.S. population, and most infected persons do not develop complications. Therefore, screening is not recommended in those who are not at increased risk. The USPSTF notes that high rates of HBV infection have been found in cities and other areas with high numbers of immigrants or migrant persons from Asia or the Pacific Islands or their adult children. Providers should consider the population they serve when making screening decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Screening Tests</strong></p>
<p>The CDC recommends screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) with tests approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, followed by a licensed, neutralizing confirmatory test for initially reactive results. Immunoassays for detecting HBsAg have a reported sensitivity and specificity greater than 98%. A positive HBsAg result indicates acute or chronic infection.</p>
<p>Testing for antibodies to HBsAg (anti-HBs) and hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) is also done as part of a screening panel to help distinguish between infection and immunity. Acute HBV infection (within 6 months after infection) is characterized by the appearance of HBsAg and followed by the appearance of immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-HBc. The disappearance of HBsAg and the presence of anti-HBs and anti-HBc indicate the resolution of HBV infection and natural immunity. Anti-HBc, which persist for life, are present only after HBV infection and do not develop in persons whose immunity to HBV is due to vaccination.</p>
<p>Persons who have received HBV vaccination have only anti-HBs. Diagnosis of chronic HBV infection is characterized by persistence of HBsAg for at least 6 months. Levels of HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) can fluctuate and are not a reliable marker of chronic infection.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<p><em>Antiviral Regimens</em></p>
<p>The goals of antiviral treatment are to achieve sustained suppression of HBV replication and remission of liver disease to prevent cirrhosis, hepatic failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Interferons or nucleoside or nucleotide analogues are used to treat HBV infection. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 7 antiviral drugs for treatment of chronic HBV infection: interferon-&amp;alpha;2b, pegylated interferon-&amp;alpha;2a, lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, telbivudine, and tenofovir. Approved first-line treatments are pegylated interferon-&amp;alpha;2a, entecavir, and tenofovir. Combination therapies have been evaluated but are not approved by the U.S. FDA and are generally not used as first-line treatment because tolerability, efficacy, and rates of resistance are low.</p>
<p>Several factors affect the choice of antiviral drug, including patient characteristics, HBV DNA and serum aminotransferase levels, and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status. Biopsy is sometimes done to determine the extent of liver inflammation and fibrosis. Surrogate end points of antiviral treatment include loss of HBeAg and HBsAg, HBeAg seroconversion in HBeAg-positive patients, and suppression of HBV DNA to undetectable levels by polymerase chain reaction in patients who are HBeAg-negative and anti-HBe&amp;ndash;positive. Duration of treatment varies depending on the time required to suppress HBV DNA levels and normalize alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, HBeAg status, the presence of cirrhosis, and the choice of drug.</p>
<p><em>Vaccination</em></p>
<p>The current U.S. strategy to eliminate HBV transmission includes <span>universal vaccination of all infants at birth and</span> vaccination of adolescents and high-risk adults, such as injection drug users and household contacts of patients with HBV infection. Three doses of HBV vaccine result in a protective antibody response greater than 90% in adults and greater than 95% in adolescents. The CDC recommends that susceptible persons who are screened for HBV infection may, if indicated, receive the first dose of the HBV vaccine at the same medical visit.</p>
<p><strong>Screening Interval</strong></p>
<p>Periodic screening may be useful in patients with ongoing risk for HBV transmission (for example, active injection drug users, men who have sex with men, and patients receiving hemodialysis) who do not receive vaccination. Clinical judgment should determine screening frequency, because the USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine specific screening intervals.</p>

<p><strong>USPSTF Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benefit</strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The USPSTF defines certainty as &quot;likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct.&quot; The net benefit is defined as benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level based on the nature of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service.</p>

<p><strong>Data Sources and Searches</strong></p>
<p>A research librarian searched MEDLINE (1946 through January 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and PsycINFO. EPC staff supplemented electronic searches by reviewing reference lists of retrieved articles.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection</strong></p>
<p>At least 2 reviewers independently evaluated each study to determine inclusion eligibility. For screening, EPC staff included randomized trials and observational studies that compared different screening strategies in asymptomatic adults without known abnormal liver enzyme levels. They also reported clinical outcomes or the sensitivity and number needed to screen (NNS) to identify 1 hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected person or provided the data to calculate these variables.</p>
<p>For treatment, EPC staff included placebo-controlled trials of vaccination of adolescents and adults without known immunity to HBV and relevant systematic reviews. For antiviral therapy, EPC staff included trials of monotherapy with a medication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration versus placebo or no treatment or first-line antiviral therapies (entecavir, tenofovir, or pegylated interferon-&amp;alpha;2a) versus other approved therapies (adefovir, nonpegylated interferon, lamivudine, or telbivudine) that reported clinical outcomes (mortality, cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, need for transplantation, or disease transmission), intermediate outcomes (histologic, virologic, or serologic), or harms (withdrawals due to adverse events, serious adverse events, or overall adverse events). EPC staff included trials of interferon-&amp;alpha;2a (not approved for HBV infection) that reported clinical outcomes because evidence for interferon-&amp;alpha;2b and pegylated interferon was limited. For the association between achieving an intermediate outcome after antiviral treatment and subsequent clinical outcomes, EPC staff included cohort studies that reported adjusted risk estimates.</p>
<p>EPC staff included only English-language articles and excluded studies published only as abstracts. EPC staff excluded trials of persons who did not respond to prior antiviral therapy or those who had virologic relapse and did not evaluate drug resistance as an outcome. They excluded studies of patients co-infected with HIV or hepatitis C virus, transplant recipients, and patients receiving hemodialysis. EPC staff excluded systematic reviews of antiviral therapies unless the staff were unable to abstract the primary studies because they were in a foreign language.

<p><strong>Data Abstraction and Quality Rating</strong></p>
<p>One investigator abstracted details about the study design, patient population, setting, screening method, interventions, analysis, follow-up, and results.

<p><strong>Data Synthesis and Analysis</strong></p>
<p>EPC staff assessed the aggregate internal validity (quality) of the body of evidence for each key question (good, fair, or poor) on the basis of the number, quality, and size of studies; consistency of results; and directness of evidence.</p>
<p>For antiviral therapy and vaccination, EPC staff conducted meta-analyses to calculate relative risks using the DerSimonian&amp;ndash;Laird random-effects model (Review Manager, version 5.2, Nordic Cochrane Centre, Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark). Primary analyses for antiviral therapy were based on total follow-up (including events after discontinuation of treatment), although EPC staff conducted sensitivity analyses of events during antiviral therapy. For harms, they analyzed events that occurred during antiviral therapy.</p>
<p>For all analyses, EPC staff stratified results by antiviral drug. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by using the I2 statistic. They did additional analyses in which trials were stratified by study quality, duration of follow-up (shorter or longer than 1 year), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status, and inclusion of patients with cirrhosis.</p></div>"/>

<p>*<em>A, B, C, D</em>, and <em>I (Insufficient)</em> represent the letter grades of recommendation or statement of insufficient evidence assigned by the USPSTF after assessing certainty and magnitude of net benefit of the service (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field).</p>
<p>The overarching question that the USPSTF seeks to answer for every preventive service is whether evidence suggests that provision of the service would improve health outcomes if implemented in a general primary care population. For screening topics, this standard could be met by a large randomized, controlled trial (RCT) in a representative asymptomatic population with follow-up of all members of both the group &quot;invited for screening&quot; and the group &quot;not invited for screening.&quot;</p>
<p>Direct RCT evidence about screening is often unavailable, so the USPSTF considers indirect evidence. To guide its selection of indirect evidence, the USPSTF constructs a &quot;chain of evidence&quot; within an analytic framework. For each key question, the body of pertinent literature is critically appraised, focusing on the following 6 questions:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Do the studies have the appropriate research design to answer the key question(s)? </li>
    <li>To what extent are the existing studies of high quality? (i.e., what is the internal validity?) </li>
    <li>To what extent are the results of the studies generalizable to the general U.S. primary care population and situation? (i.e., what is the external validity?) </li>
    <li>How many studies have been conducted that address the key question(s)? How large are the studies? (i.e., what is the precision of the evidence?) </li>
    <li>How consistent are the results of the studies? </li>
    <li>Are there additional factors that assist the USPSTF in drawing conclusions (e.g., presence or absence of dose&amp;ndash;response effects, fit within a biologic model)? </li>
</ol>
<p>The next step in the USPSTF process is to use the evidence from the key questions to assess whether there would be net benefit if the service were implemented. In 2001, the USPSTF published an article that documented its systematic processes of evidence evaluation and recommendation development. At that time, the USPSTF's overall assessment of evidence was described as good, fair, or poor. The USPSTF realized that this rating seemed to apply only to how well studies were conducted and did not fully capture all of the issues that go into an overall assessment of the evidence about net benefit. To avoid confusion, the USPSTF has changed its terminology. Whereas individual study quality will continue to be characterized as good, fair, or poor, the term certainty will now be used to describe the USPSTF's assessment of the overall body of evidence about net benefit of a preventive service and the likelihood that the assessment is correct. Certainty will be determined by considering all 6 questions listed above; the judgment about certainty will be described as high, moderate, or low.</p>
<p>In making its assessment of certainty about net benefit, the evaluation of the evidence from each key question plays a primary role. It is important to note that the USPSTF makes recommendations for real-world medical practice in the United States and must determine to what extent the evidence for each key question&amp;mdash;even evidence from screening RCTs or treatment RCTs&amp;mdash;can be applied to the general primary care population. Frequently, studies are conducted in highly selected populations under special conditions. The USPSTF must consider differences between the general primary care population and the populations studied in RCTs and make judgments about the likelihood of observing the same effect in actual practice.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that one of the key questions in the analytic framework refers to the potential harms of the preventive service. The USPSTF considers the evidence about the benefits and harms of preventive services separately and equally. Data about harms are often obtained from observational studies because harms observed in RCTs may not be representative of those found in usual practice and because some harms are not completely measured and reported in RCTs.</p>
<p>Putting the body of evidence for all key questions together as a chain, the USPSTF assesses the certainty of net benefit of a preventive service by asking the 6 major questions listed above. The USPSTF would rate a body of convincing evidence about the benefits of a service that, for example, derives from several RCTs of screening in which the estimate of benefits can be generalized to the general primary care population as &quot;high&quot; certainty (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field). The USPSTF would rate a body of evidence that was not clearly applicable to general practice or has other defects in quality, research design, or consistency of studies as &quot;moderate&quot; certainty. Certainty is &quot;low&quot; when, for example, there are gaps in the evidence linking parts of the analytic framework, when evidence to determine the harms of treatment is unavailable, or when evidence about the benefits of treatment is insufficient. Table 4 in the methodology document listed below (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) summarizes the current terminology used by the USPSTF to describe the critical assessment of evidence at all 3 levels: individual studies, key questions, and overall certainty of net benefit of the preventive service.</p>

<p><strong>USPSTF Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benefit</strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The USPSTF defines certainty as &quot;likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct.&quot; The net benefit is defined as benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level based on the nature of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service.</p>

Before the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes its final determinations about recommendations on a given preventive service, the Evidence-based Practice Center and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality send a draft evidence review to 4 to 6 external experts and to Federal agencies and professional and disease-based health organizations with interests in the topic. The experts are asked to examine the review critically for accuracy and completeness and to respond to a series of specific questions about the document. After assembling these external review comments and documenting the proposed response to key comments, the topic team presents this information to the USPSTF in memo form. In this way, the USPSTF can consider these external comments before it votes on its recommendations about the service. Draft recommendation statements are then circulated for comment among reviewers representing professional societies, voluntary organizations, and Federal agencies, as well as posted on the USPSTF Web site for public comment. These comments are discussed before the final recommendations are confirmed.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Response to Public Comment.</span> A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 11 February to 10 March 2014. Some comments requested clarification about risk factors, screening tests, vaccinations, and screening frequency. Others asked for a definition of &quot;immunosuppressed.&quot;</p>
<p>In response to these comments, the USPSTF added language about populations that are at risk in the Clinical Considerations section. The USPSTF also added language to clarify about screening tests and vaccination. Language was added to the section on research gaps. Text was added to address screening frequency and to clarify the definition of &quot;immunosuppressed.&quot;</p>

<p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found no randomized, controlled trials that provide direct evidence of the health benefits (that is, reduction in morbidity, mortality, and disease transmission) of screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in asymptomatic, nonpregnant adolescents and adults.</p>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that HBV vaccination is effective at decreasing disease acquisition.</p>
<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that antiviral treatment in patients with chronic HBV infection is effective at improving intermediate outcomes (that is,&amp;nbsp;virologic or histologic improvement or clearance of hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg]) and adequate evidence that antiviral regimens improve health outcomes (such as reduced risk for hepatocellular carcinoma). The evidence showed an association between improvement in intermediate outcomes after antiviral therapy and improvement in clinical outcomes, but outcomes were heterogeneous and the studies had methodological limitations.</p>
<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that education or behavior change counseling reduces disease transmission.</p>
<p>The prevalence of HBV infection differs among various populations. As a result, the magnitude of benefit of screening varies according to risk group.</p>
<p>The USPSTF concludes that screening is of moderate benefit for populations at high risk for HBV infection, given the accuracy of the screening test and the effectiveness of antiviral treatment.</p></div>"/>

<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that antiviral therapy regimens are associated with a higher risk for withdrawal due to adverse events than placebo. However, trials found no difference in the risk for serious adverse events or the number of participants who had any adverse event.

    <field fieldid="131" ordby="1010" id="436" name="Description of Implementation Strategy" type="text">
      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The experiences of the first and second U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), as well as that of other evidence-based guideline efforts, have highlighted the importance of identifying effective ways to implement clinical recommendations. Practice guidelines are relatively weak tools for changing clinical practice when used in isolation. To effect change, guidelines must be coupled with strategies to improve their acceptance and feasibility. Such strategies include enlisting the support of local opinion leaders, using reminder systems for clinicians and patients, adopting standing orders, and audit and feedback of information to clinicians about their compliance with recommended practice.</p>
<p>In the case of preventive services guidelines, implementation needs to go beyond traditional dissemination and promotion efforts to recognize the added patient and clinician barriers that affect preventive care. These include clinicians' ambivalence about whether preventive medicine is part of their job, the psychological and practical challenges that patients face in changing behaviors, lack of access to health care or of insurance coverage for preventive services for some patients, competing pressures within the context of shorter office visits, and the lack of organized systems in most practices to ensure the delivery of recommended preventive care.</p>
<p>Dissemination strategies have changed dramatically in this age of electronic information. While recognizing the continuing value of journals and other print formats for dissemination, the USPSTF will make all its products available through its <a href=&quot;http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/&quot; title=&quot;USPSTF Web site&quot;>Web site</a>. The combination of electronic access and extensive material in the public domain should make it easier for a broad audience of users to access USPSTF materials and adapt them for their local needs. Online access to USPSTF products also opens up new possibilities for the appearance of the annual, pocket-size Guide to Clinical Preventive Services.</p>
<p>To be successful, approaches for implementing prevention have to be tailored to the local level and deal with the specific barriers at a given site, typically requiring the redesign of systems of care. Such a systems approach to prevention has had notable success in established staff-model health maintenance organizations, by addressing organization of care, emphasizing a philosophy of prevention, and altering the training and incentives for clinicians. Staff-model plans also benefit from integrated information systems that can track the use of needed services and generate automatic reminders aimed at patients and clinicians, some of the most consistently successful interventions. Information systems remain a major challenge for individual clinicians' offices, however, as well as for looser affiliations of practices in network-model managed care and independent practice associations, where data on patient visits, referrals, and test results are not always centralized.</p></div>"/>
