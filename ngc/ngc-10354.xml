<p>The recommendations adopted from a clinical practice guideline (CPG) are indicated by the &quot;CPG&quot; superscript.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Evaluation and Treatment</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Risk Factors Associated with Suicidal Behaviour and Suicide Risk Assessment</strong></p>
<p><strong>D<sup>CPG</sup></strong>: After suicidal behaviour, adequate psychopathological and social assessment is always recommended, including psychological and contextual features for the patient, as well as an evaluation of risk and protective factors for suicidal behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: Health professionals involved in the care of patients with suicidal behaviour should have adequate training to enable them to evaluate the presence of risk factors for suicidal behaviour and record the patient's risk profile.</p>
<p><strong>D<sup>CPG</sup></strong>: All the information collected during the evaluation process should be properly recorded in the medical record.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Professionals should explain the purpose of the evaluation to patients and their relatives, and try to involve them as an active part of the therapeutic process.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: Communication of the patient's symptoms, thoughts and feelings associated with suicidal behaviour should be encouraged from the start of the clinical interview, and the patient and his relatives should be encouraged to be involved in the decision-making process.</p>
<p><strong>D<sup>CPG</sup></strong>: It is advisable to have patient information from other sources, including family, and friends, as well as other health professionals or caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: The clinical interview should be directed towards the collection of objective, descriptive and subjective information (patient's narrative, thoughts and ideas) and should be adapted to its objectives: regarding the setting, circumstances, time available, conditions of the interviewee and preparation of the interviewer.</p>
<p><strong>D<sup>CPG</sup></strong>: The estimation of suicide risk of a patient must be made by a professional clinical judgment, taking into account the presence of risk and protective factors.</p>
<p>The following should mainly be considered in assessing a suicide risk:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><strong>A</strong>: Presence of previous suicide attempts and substance abuse </li>
    <li><strong>B</strong>: Presence of mental disorders, and specific symptoms such as hopelessness, anxiety, agitation and severe suicidal ideation (recurrent thoughts of death every day, and most of the time), as well as stressful events and the availability of methods. </li>
    <li><strong>C</strong>: Risk factors associated with repetition, physical illness, chronicity, pain or disability, family history of suicide, social and environmental factors and a history of suicide in the environment. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D</strong>: The clinical interview should not be replaced by the use of self- and observer reporting scales, although they can contribute additional information in the evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: Of the different scales available, the ones recommended are Beck's Hopelessness, Suicidal Ideation and Suicide Intent scales, as well as the items on suicidal behaviour from the Beck Depression Inventory and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: Although not validated in Spain, the SAD PERSONS and IS PATH WARM scales are also recommended for their ease of application.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: When assessing a patient with multiple suicide attempts, it is recommended to evaluate the causes or precipitants of each of them independently.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: Any negative attitudes towards people with repeated suicidal behaviour should be avoided, encouraging professional care based on respect and understanding for these patients.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment and Management of Suicidal Ideation and Behaviour in Primary Care</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: Training is recommended for primary care physicians in the assessment and treatment of suicidal ideation and behaviour, as well as for implementing specific programmes about their diagnosis and psychotherapeutic approach, where appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: It is recommended to investigate suicidal thoughts in patients who are suspected of having suicidal ideation and who have suicide risk factors. This does not increase the risk of suicide.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: It is recommended that patients are asked about their thoughts of suicide gradually. The interviewer must not be demanding or coercive, but have a warm and empathetic approach.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: If the presence of suicidal ideation is confirmed, specific questions aimed at assessing the real possibility of suicide (e.g., frequency and seriousness of ideas, degree of planning) will be needed.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: The following is required when dealing with patients with suicidal ideation or suicide risk:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Prescribing drugs which are safe if overdosed </li>
    <li>Prescribe containers with the fewest tablets possible </li>
    <li>Explain the need for controlled custody and administration of the medication by the family </li>
    <li>Constant accompaniment by family members, as well as restricting access to lethal methods </li>
    <li>Acceptance by the patient and family of the need for follow-up and referral to the mental health services </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D</strong>: After a suicide attempt in the field of primary care, the physical condition of the patient should first be assessed, before any decision is made on the need for referral to a hospital for treatment of the injuries.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: After a suicide attempt in the field of primary care, an assessment including the following is recommended, where possible:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Features of the attempt </li>
    <li>Previous attempts at self-harm </li>
    <li>Social and demographic factors </li>
    <li>Associated mental disorders </li>
    <li>Family history </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D</strong>: An <strong>urgent referral</strong> to <strong>mental health services</strong> for a patient with suicidal <strong>ideation</strong> is recommended in the following cases:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Presence of severe mental illness </li>
    <li>Recent serious suicidal behaviour </li>
    <li>A prepared suicide plan </li>
    <li>Expression of suicidal intent </li>
    <li>Social and family situation at risk or lack of support </li>
    <li>If in doubt about the severity of ideation or the risk of an immediate attempt </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D</strong>: In cases of <strong>suicide attempt</strong>, <strong>urgent referral</strong> to a <strong>hospital emergency department</strong> is recommended if:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>There is a need for medical treatment of the injuries produced, which may not be met in primary care </li>
    <li>Voluntary intoxication with decreased level of consciousness or agitation (after stabilisation of the patient) has occurred </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D</strong>: In cases of <strong>suicide attempt</strong>, and in the absence of the above, <strong>urgent referral</strong> to <strong>mental health services</strong> is recommended if there is a:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>High lethality of the plan, regardless of the outcome </li>
    <li>Presence of severe mental illness </li>
    <li>Recent severe self-harm behaviour </li>
    <li>Previous suicide attempts </li>
    <li>Social and family situation at risk or lack of support </li>
    <li>If in doubt about the severity of the episode or risk of recurrence </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: A transfer to mental health services (within a week) may be considered for patients with suicidal ideation or behaviour without any of the above criteria for immediate referral if all of the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Relief after the interview </li>
    <li>Intention to control suicidal impulses </li>
    <li>Acceptance of treatment and containment measures agreed </li>
    <li>Effective social and family support </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: All patient information will be recorded in the clinical history as well as the reasoning behind any referrals.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: After an episode of suicidal behaviour, proper communication between the mental health services and primary care physician is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Assessing and Managing Patients with Suicidal Behaviour in the Emergency Department</strong></p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: All patients who attend the emergency department for suicidal behaviour should undergo triage to ensure they are attended within the first hour after arrival.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: The brief version of the Horowitz suicide risk questionnaire is proposed for use by emergency department triage staff for patients attending for suicidal behaviour without any severe affectation of their physical condition.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: The assessment of patients with suicidal behaviour should be conducted in an atmosphere of privacy, confidentiality and respect.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: All available security measures to prevent escape and aggression to themselves or others should be taken while in the emergency department.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: Besides assessing any change in the physical condition of the patient with suicidal behaviour, the hospital emergency doctor should always perform a basic social and psychopathological assessment.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: When assessing a patient with suicidal behaviour, a systematic assessment of the risk factors and recording of the most relevant features of the suicide attempt is recommended; preferably using a standard form, with all information properly documented in the medical record.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: It is suggested that patients with a suicide attempt are assessed by a psychiatrist, when recommended by the emergency department doctor.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: Referral to a psychiatrist by the emergency physician should be performed when the patient is fully conscious and an appropriate psychopathological assessment can be performed.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: Sometimes the patient's psychiatric evaluation may be deferred, and the patient preferentially referred for a mental health consultation.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: Improvements in the following areas of care for people with suicidal behaviour are recommended:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Communication between patients and staff </li>
    <li>An empathetic attitude from staff </li>
    <li>Access to specialist health care </li>
    <li>Information on suicidal behaviour for patients, caregivers and families </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D</strong>: Staff who are not mental health specialists should receive appropriate training in the assessment of patients who present with suicidal behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: Training for the emergency physician in the care of patients with suicidal behaviour should include those aspects considered for their competence, including:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Assessment of mental status and capacity of the patient and mood </li>
    <li>Skills in detecting immediate suicide risk </li>
    <li>Basic legal knowledge for emergency medical situations </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D<sup>CPG</sup></strong>: The decision to hospitalise a patient after suicidal behaviour is often a complex process. The following factors should mainly be considered:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Medical and surgical repercussions of the suicidal behaviour </li>
    <li>Immediate suicide risk of the patient </li>
    <li>Need for more intensive treatment of the baseline mental disorder </li>
    <li>Lack of effective family and social support </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatment of Suicidal Behaviour in Specialist Care (Mental Health)</strong></p>
<p><em>General Recommendations</em></p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: It is recommended to address suicidal behaviour from a broad perspective, in which the pharmacological, psychotherapeutic and psychosocial interventions from which the patient may benefit are comprehensively assessed with the involvement of health professionals from different levels of care.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: It is advisable to promote the development of a strong therapeutic alliance between patient and professional, and to have the support of the patient environment as a fundamental part of the therapeutic process.</p>
<p><em>Psychotherapeutic Interventions</em></p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: Psychotherapeutic techniques play an important role in the treatment of patients with suicidal behaviour. Therefore it is recommended to ensure they are available for those who need them.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: In general, psychotherapeutic treatments of a cognitive-behavioural type are recommended for patients with suicidal behaviour on a weekly basis, at least at the beginning of the treatment.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: Psychotherapy should always be directed at some specific aspect of the suicidal spectrum (suicidal ideation, hopelessness, self-harm or other forms of suicidal behaviour).</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: Individual cognitive-behavioural sessions are recommended for adults with suicidal ideation or behaviour, although the inclusion of group sessions as an adjunct to individual treatment can be assessed.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: Although other psychotherapeutic techniques could be evaluated, dialectical behavioural therapy must be considered preferential in adults diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: Specific psychotherapeutic treatment is recommended in adolescents: dialectical behavioural therapy in borderline personality disorder and cognitive behavioural therapy in major depression.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: Interpersonal therapy is recommended for adults with suicidal behaviour, patients over 60 years old with depression and suicidal ideation and in adolescents with suicide risk.</p>
<p><em>Pharmacotherapy</em></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: It is recommended to use preferentially treatment with antidepressants from the group of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in adults with major depression presenting suicidal ideation.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Patients over 60 years with major depression and suicidal behaviour are recommended to have monitoring continued over time with the use of combination therapy (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors + interpersonal therapy).</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: In adolescents with major depression and suicidal ideation, the use of combination therapy (fluoxetine + cognitive behavioural therapy) is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>D<sup>CPG</sup></strong>: The use of anxiolytic agents at the start of treatment with antidepressants in patients with major depression and suicidal ideation who also experience anxiety or agitation is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: In patients with bipolar disorder and suicidal ideation, the use of antidepressants alone is not recommended unless accompanied by a mood stabilizer.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Lithium treatment is recommended in adult patients with bipolar disorder who have suicidal behaviour, due to its mood stabilising effect and potential for antisuicidal action.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: In adult patients with major depression and recent suicidal behaviour, a combination of lithium and antidepressant treatment is recommended to be assessed.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: When ending lithium treatment, withdrawal should be done gradually, at least during two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: For anticonvulsant treatment of borderline personality disorder, carbamazepine is recommended as the first choice drug to control the risk of suicidal behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: In patients with bipolar disorder and suicide risk requiring anticonvulsant therapy, continuous treatment with valproic acid or carbamazepine is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: Special attention must be paid to the presence of suicidal ideation or behaviour in patients with suicide risk factors after treatment for epilepsy.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: To reduce the risk of suicidal behaviour, the use of clozapine is recommended in the treatment of adult patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder at high risk of suicidal behaviour.</p>
<p><em>Electroconvulsive Therapy</em></p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: The decision to use electroconvulsive therapy should be taken after consultation with the patient, taking into account factors such as diagnosis, type and severity of the symptoms, medical history, risk/benefit ratio, alternative options and patient preferences. Written informed consent must be obtained in all cases.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: It is recommended that electroconvulsive therapy always be given by an experienced professional, following a physical and psychiatric assessment in a hospital setting.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: Electroconvulsive therapy is recommended in patients with severe major depression where there is a need for a rapid response due to the presence of high suicidal intent.</p>
<p><strong>D<sup>CPG</sup></strong>: Electroconvulsive therapy is also indicated in adolescents with severe, major and persistent depression, with behaviours that endanger their lives, or those who do not respond to other treatments.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Prevention</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>General Measures to Prevent Suicidal Behaviour</strong></p>
<p><em>General Programmes for the Prevention of Suicidal Behaviour</em></p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: The health authorities are recommended to implement the following specific lines of action for the prevention of suicidal behaviour:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Development of preventive programmes in populations at risk </li>
    <li>Training of health professionals in the detection of suicide risk and identification of risk and protective factors </li>
    <li>Education of the general population and media </li>
    <li>Improving procedures for identification, treatment and monitoring of people at risk of suicide </li>
    <li>Improving access to health services and providing the right treatment to people with suicidal behaviour </li>
    <li>Removing the taboo and stigma attached to mental illness and suicide in both health workers and the general public </li>
    <li>Promoting research on suicide prevention </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Enhancing Protective Factors and Resilience</em></p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: The preparation and implementation of suicide prevention programmes based on enhancing protective factors and factors associated with resilience is recommended.</p>
<p><em>Restricting Access to Lethal Means</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: It is recommended to reduce the availability of or limit access to lethal means of suicide, particularly those used most in a particular country:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Restriction on the sale of psychotropic drugs </li>
    <li>Reducing the size of drug packs in general </li>
    <li>Using less toxic antidepressants </li>
    <li>Reducing the emissions of carbon monoxide from vehicles </li>
    <li>Lowering the toxicity of domestic gas </li>
    <li>Installation of barriers in high places </li>
    <li>Restriction on the possession and control of firearms </li>
    <li>Control of pesticides </li>
</ul>
<p><em>The Media and Suicide</em></p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: The media are recommended to follow the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines when reporting news about suicides, among which are:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Not sensationalising news about suicides </li>
    <li>Avoiding specific details about its features or circumstances </li>
    <li>Providing information accurately, responsibly and ethically </li>
    <li>Taking the opportunity to educate the public </li>
    <li>Providing information on available aid resources </li>
    <li>Taking into account the impact that the information can have on the families and friends after a suicide at all times </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: Measures at a national or regional level aimed at promoting the implementation of the WHO and similar guidelines to promote the proper treatment of suicide in the media are recommended.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: The implementation of measures to promote the Internet as an instrument to encourage mental health and suicide prevention is recommended. Examples of possible measures are:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Trying to have pages with useful information for patients - aimed at suicide prevention or offering support - appearing in a priority location when performing a search with key terms </li>
    <li>Regulating the control of Internet content by legislation, the involvement of organisations or service providers </li>
    <li>Using filtering software to prevent access to certain forums or blogs </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Training Programs for the Prevention of Suicidal Behaviour</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Health Personnel</span></p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: In general, it is recommended that programmes for training of health personnel on suicidal behaviour include information on risk and protection factors, assessment and crisis intervention strategies. The format may be on-site, online or mixed, and based on lectures, case discussions and role-playing.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: It is recommended that training programmes include booster sessions on a regular basis (at least every 2 years).</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: It is recommended to evaluate training programmes after their implementation, particularly their influence on clinical practice.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: Training programmes in primary care are recommended to include the detection and treatment of depression, as well as specific content about suicide.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: It is recommended that emergency services training programmes address the general aspects of suicide and enhance the development of skills in the clinical interview for the detection of comorbid psychiatric disorders, as well as suicide risk factors and groups.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: Training programmes for mental health services are recommended to include the acquisition of skills in the management and prevention of suicidal behaviour, as well as general aspects of suicide.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Non-Health Personnel</span></p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: Training programmes for non-medical personnel (e.g., teachers, educators, firefighters or police) are recommended to primarily address risk factors for suicidal behaviour, preventive aspects, crisis intervention and information about seeking professional help.</p>
<p><strong>Screening for Suicide Risk</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: In the general population, there is insufficient evidence to either recommend or not recommend suicide risk screening in adults.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: In educational institutions, the evidence on the effectiveness and the possible impact on suicidal behaviour does not support the recommendation of implementation of screening programmes.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: In primary care, it is suggested to implement suicide risk screening programmes in adolescents with the presence of suicide risk factors who may need to be referred to a specialist service. The Risk of Suicide Questionnaire (RSQ) can be used as a screening tool as it is the only one validated in Spanish.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: In the emergency department, it is recommended to conduct suicide risk screening in adolescents with the presence of risk factors (e.g., depressive disorders, alcohol use or impulsivity) or with associated stress factors (e.g., break-up of relationships, unwanted pregnancies or exposure to cases of attempted or completed suicides), even if attending for other reasons.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: Implementation of screening for depression associated with appropriate follow-up and health education programmes is recommended in the elderly, as they lessen the risk of suicide. The 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) or the 5-item GDS subscale (GDS-SI) could be used as screening tools.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: Suicide risk screening of prisoners is recommended on admission to prison, with subsequent observation and monitoring. No evidence has been found to recommend a screening scale in this population.</p>
<p><strong>Suicidal Behaviour in Risk Groups</strong></p>
<p><em>Suicidal Behaviour in Children and Adolescents</em></p>
<p><strong>D<sup>CPG</sup></strong>: Children and adolescents with presence of risk factors for suicidal behaviour are recommended to undergo a comprehensive psychopathological and social assessment. The evaluation must follow the same principles as in adults, while considering the particular psychopathological aspects of childhood and adolescence, and paying special attention to the family and the social situation.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: To assess suicide risk in children or adolescents, it is recommended to ask directly about suicidal ideation or planning, past suicidal behaviour and other risk factors, as well as extend the evaluation to people close to the subjects (parents or teachers).</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: The following scales are recommended for use in childhood and adolescence when being used to supplement the clinical interview:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>

    <li>Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) </li>
    <li>Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (K-SADS) </li>
    <li>Children Depression Rating Scale, Revised (CDRS-R) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C</strong>: Universal suicide prevention programmes, such as Signs of Suicide, are recommended to be implemented as part of the school curriculum, after being adapted and contextualised to the sociocultural environment.</p>

<p><strong>C</strong>: There are insufficient data to recommend the use of suicide screening tools or programmes in schools.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: The implementation of key figure training programmes (gatekeeper) for staff at educational institutions is recommended, to identify students at risk of suicide.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: The following is recommended to prevent suicidal behaviour in children and adolescents with mental disorders:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Conducting a thorough assessment of suicide risk for the most beneficial treatment strategy in each case </li>
    <li>Paying particular attention to the presence of comorbidity </li>
    <li>Periodically assessing symptoms of depression, suicidal ideation and the possible presence of stressful life events </li>
    <li>Encouraging coordination among different levels of healthcare professionals to carry out appropriate monitoring </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: The treatment options recommended for assessment for suicidal behaviour in childhood and adolescence are psychotherapeutic, drug, combination therapy and in rare cases, electroconvulsive therapy.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: Guidelines should be provided for parents and/or carers on the control of direct access by children and adolescents to drugs, firearms or other potentially lethal means.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: Clinicians are recommended take into account the pathological use or misuse of the Internet when assessing the risk of suicide, especially in adolescents and young adults.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: Easily accessible information on suicidal behaviour and its prevention should be specifically prepared for adolescents and their families and offered on the Internet.</p>
<p><em>Suicidal Behaviour in the Elderly</em></p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: When assessing the risk of suicide in the elderly, it is especially recommended to check for the presence of depression, other illnesses, alcohol abuse or abuse of any other medication.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: It is also recommended to assess the environment, quality of life and expectations of the person:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Who he lives with, the presence of support and social and family relationships </li>
    <li>Ability to care for himself and to carry out daily living activities </li>
    <li>Presence of hopelessness, patient attitude toward life and death </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C</strong>: The use of validated scales such as the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is recommended when using scales to supplement the clinical interview in the older person.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: Education about suicide is recommended for the elderly themselves, as well as their carers and the general public, including the media, to raise awareness and reduce stigma.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: The doctor is recommended to prescribe drugs in smaller packs and monitor their use when dealing with patients with suicide risk factors.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: Community support interventions are recommended for the elderly at risk of suicide, e.g. telephone lines, group activities and psychoeducation.</p>
<p><strong>D<sup>CPG</sup></strong>: In general, the recommendations for adults when managing and treating suicidal behaviour should also be used for the older age groups.</p>
<p><em>Preventing Suicidal Behaviour in Other Risk Groups</em></p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: Persons with chronic illnesses and severe pain or physical disability are recommended to undergo preventive programmes and specific suicide risk assessments.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: It is recommended to perform a special monitoring of those patients with risk factors for suicide at the following times: when being diagnosed with a serious illness; when there is a poor prognosis of an illness; or when it is at an advanced stage.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong>: General strategies for managing patients with chronic illness, physical disability or chronic pain should be carried out at three different levels:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Universal:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Evaluate hopelessness and suicidal ideation. </li>
        <li>Monitor the warning signs that may increase the level of risk, such as depressive symptoms, substance abuse or a history of suicidal behaviour. </li>
        <li>Recognize that people may be at risk regardless of the time after the injury. </li>
        <li>Provide patients with the availability of long-term support. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Selective:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Follow-up persons with comorbid psychiatric disorders. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Indicated (presence of suicidal ideation and/or behaviour):
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Reduce access to potentially lethal methods, including the possibility of more than one method. </li>
        <li>Provide treatment, support and monitoring for at least 12 months after a suicide attempt. </li>
        <li>Encourage the participation of friends and family in the treatment planning and development. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D</strong>: A suicide risk assessment is recommended in carers with depressive symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: Carers with anxiety, depression and overload are recommended to undergo cognitive-behavioural type interventions to reduce the risk of suicide.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: Health promotion programmes are recommended in the workplace to offer support and advice to workers and to increase the degree of integration and access to prevention services.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: It is recommended to evaluate the employment situation of people at risk of suicide.</p>

<p>Clinical practice guidelines (CPG) are tools for promoting greater quality and equity in the provision of healthcare and to assist in decision making. Their main purpose is to convert scientific knowledge into specific recommendations that will help the clinician in clinical practice, thus appropriate dissemination and implementation are crucial.</p>
<p>This CPG has two versions, the complete and the summary version, as well as two information documents for patients and families (on suicidal behaviour and the grief process after a suicide) and one about methodological material. The full version, information for patients and the methodology document can be accessed via the website of the Galicia Health Technology Assessment Agency (<a href=&quot;http://avalia-t.sergas.es&quot; title=&quot;Galicia Health Technology Assessment Agency Web site&quot;>http://avalia-t.sergas.es</a>) and Gu&amp;iacute;aSalud (<a href=&quot;http://portal.guiasalud.es&quot; title=&quot;GuiaSalud Web site&quot;>http://portal.guiasalud.es</a>).</p>
<p>The proposed strategies for the dissemination and implementation of this CPG are as follows:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Official presentation of the guide by health authorities and individual delivery to potential professional users. </li>
    <li>Dissemination of the guide in electronic format on the websites of the health services, companies and associations involved in the project. </li>
    <li>Distribution of information to patients and family and friends by working with different patient associations. </li>
    <li>Delivery of the guide to both national and international CPG database collectors. </li>
    <li>Presentation of the guideline in primary and specialty care through interactive lectures and workshops with patients, family members and concerned citizens. </li>
    <li>Presentation of the guide in scientific activities (conferences, congresses and meetings). </li>
    <li>To be used in online and/or on-site training for the management and assessment of patients with suicidal ideation or behaviour. </li>
    <li>Publication of the guide in medical and psychological journals. </li>
    <li>Establishment of best practice criteria for patients with suicidal ideation and/or behaviour in programme contracts and clinical management contracts. </li>
    <li>Establishing clinical decision support systems that integrate the guide with selected indicators in the software used in primary care, emergency care or specialised care. </li>
