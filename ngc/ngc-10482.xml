	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The recommendations were adapted from the three guidelines (original recommendation matrix provided in the Methodology Supplement [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]) by a multidisciplinary group of experts using evidence from the supplementary literature search and clinical experience as a guide. The majority of the recommendation text is listed verbatim from the three guidelines; however, there are some instances where the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) expert panel made modifications or additions to the recommendations to reflect local context, practice beliefs, and updated empiric evidence. These changes are identified with the words &quot;modified from&quot; preceding the guideline title after each subsection heading. Figure 1 in the original guideline document presents a two-page screening, assessment, treatment, and care map algorithm for fatigue adapted from the pan-Canadian guideline. Copyright permission for the adaption was obtained from the authors of the pan-Canadian and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definition</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Modified from NCCN Guideline for Cancer-Related Fatigue and NCCN Guideline for Survivorship</em></p>
<p>Cancer-related fatigue is a distressing, persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional, and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer and/or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning. These guidelines are focused on fatigue in patients who have completed primary cancer treatment and/or are in clinical remission.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Screening</strong></p>
<p><em>Modified from pan-Canadian guideline and NCCN Guideline for Cancer-Related Fatigue</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>All health care providers should routinely screen for the presence of fatigue from the point of diagnosis onward, including after completion of primary treatment. </li>
    <li>All patients should be screened for fatigue as clinically indicated and at least annually. </li>
    <li>Screening should be performed and documented using a quantitative or semi-quantitative assessment. For example, on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale (0, no fatigue; 10, worst fatigue imaginable), mild fatigue is indicated as a score of 1 to 3, moderate fatigue as 4 to 6, and severe fatigue as 7 to 10. Because fatigue is rarely an isolated symptom, a multi-symptom screening tool may have greater clinical utility. Patients who report moderate to severe fatigue should undergo a comprehensive and focused assessment. </li>
</ul>
<p>Table 1 in the original guideline document lists selected instruments for the measurement of fatigue, which could be used to supplement initial screening with the 0 to 10 numeric scale.</p>
<p><strong>Comprehensive and Focused Assessment</strong></p>
<p><em>Modified from NCCN Guideline for Survivorship</em></p>
<p>Regarding history and physical, first, perform a focused fatigue history, including:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Onset, pattern, and duration </li>
    <li>Change over time </li>
    <li>Associated or alleviating factors </li>
</ul>
<p>Second, evaluate disease status by:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Evaluating risk of recurrence based on stage, pathologic factors, and treatment history </li>
    <li>Performing a review of systems to determine if other symptoms substantiate suspicion for recurrence </li>
</ul>
<p>Third, assess treatable contributing factors, including:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Comorbidities (see Table 2 in the original guideline document) </li>
    <li>Medications (consider persistent use of sleep aids, pain medications, or antiemetics) </li>
    <li>Alcohol/substance abuse </li>
    <li>Nutritional issues (including weight/caloric intake changes) </li>
    <li>Decreased functional status </li>
    <li>Deconditioning/decreased activity level </li>
</ul>
<p>As a shared responsibility, the clinical team must decide when referral to an appropriately trained professional (e.g., cardiologist, endocrinologist, mental health professional, internist, and so on) is needed.</p>
<p><strong>Laboratory Evaluation</strong></p>
<p><em>NCCN Guideline for Survivorship Verbatim</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Consider performing laboratory evaluation based on presence of other symptoms, onset, and severity of fatigue. </li>
    <li>Complete blood cell count with differential: compare end-of-treatment hemoglobin/hematocrit with current values; assess other cell lines (white blood cells [WBC] and platelets). </li>
    <li>Comprehensive metabolic panel: assess electrolytes; assess hepatic and renal function. </li>
    <li>Endocrinologic evaluation: TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone); consider more comprehensive evaluation or referral to specialist if other symptoms present. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatment and Care Options</strong></p>
<p><em>Modified from Pan-Canadian Guideline and NCCN Guideline for Cancer-Related Fatigue</em></p>
<p>Regarding education and counseling:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>All patients should be offered specific education about fatigue after treatment (e.g., information about the difference between normal and cancer-related fatigue, persistence of fatigue after treatment, and causes and contributing factors). </li>
    <li>Patients should be offered advice on general strategies that help manage fatigue (e.g., physical activity, guidance on self-monitoring of fatigue levels). </li>
    <li>If treated for fatigue, patients should be observed and reevaluated on a regular basis to determine whether treatment is effective or needs to be reassessed. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatment of Contributing Factors</strong></p>
<p><em>Modified from Pan-Canadian Guidelines and NCCN Guideline for Survivorship</em></p>
<p>Address all medical and substance-induced treatable contributing factors first (e.g., comorbidities, medications, nutritional issues, activity level). Table 2 in the original guideline document provides more details. Some patients can also benefit from interventions described in this article to treat fatigue. Currently, there are no clear standards for selecting among these to treat an individual patient. Further research is needed to establish a strategy for prioritizing, sequencing, and linking the available options.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Activity</strong></p>
<p><em>Modified from Pan-Canadian Guideline and NCCN Guideline for Survivorship</em></p>
<p>Several meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and randomized trials have demonstrated that initiating or maintaining adequate levels of physical activity can reduce cancer-related fatigue in post-treatment patients. For example, a recent meta-analysis of 27 exercise intervention trials conducted with patients after treatment completion found that exercise training significantly reduced fatigue, with a mean effect size of 0.38 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21 to 0.43).</p>
<p>Actively encourage all patients to engage in a moderate level of physical activity after cancer treatment (e.g., 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise, such as fast walking, cycling, or swimming, per week with an additional two to three sessions per week of strength training, such as weight lifting, unless contraindicated).</p>
<p>Walking programs are generally safe for most cancer survivors; the American College of Sports Medicine recommends that cancer survivors begin this type of program after consulting with their physician but without any formal exercise testing (such as a stress test).</p>
<p>Survivors at higher risk of injury (e.g., those living with neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, or other long-term effects of therapy other than comorbidities) should be referred to a physical therapist or exercise specialist. Breast cancer survivors with lymphedema should also consider meeting with an exercise specialist before initiating upper-body strength training.</p>
<p>Encourage survivors to make use of empirically based programs and local resources that are consistent with guideline recommendations. For patients with severe fatigue interfering with function, consider referral to a physical therapist or physiatrist.</p>
<p>Common barriers to physical activity in cancer survivors include physical and disease-related limitations (e.g., illness, pain, fatigue, weakness) as well as lack of time, lack of interest/motivation, lack of facilities, and lack of encouragement from family or friends. To overcome these barriers, survivors should be encouraged to avoid inactivity by, at the minimum, engaging in exercises such as walking or using a stationary bicycle or cycle ergometer, beginning at an easy pace and progressing gradually to moderate intensity. Counseling and motivational interviewing have also been shown to encourage exercise adherence.</p>
<p><strong>Psychosocial Interventions</strong></p>
<p><em>Modified from NCCN Guideline for Survivorship</em></p>
<p>Several meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and randomized trials have indicated that cognitive behavioral therapy/behavioral therapy can reduce fatigue in cancer survivors. For example, a cognitive behavioral intervention that targeted dysfunctional thoughts about fatigue, poor coping strategies, and dysregulated sleep and activity patterns in a mixed sample of fatigued cancer survivors led to significant improvements in fatigue that were sustained over long-term follow-up.</p>
<p>Several systematic reviews and randomized trials have suggested that psychoeducational/educational therapies may reduce fatigue in cancer survivors. For example, an Internet-based educational program that provided tailored information on cancer-related fatigue, physical activity, pain control, distress management, sleep hygiene, nutrition, and energy conservation led to significant improvements in fatigue in a mixed sample of fatigued cancer survivors.</p>
<p>Survivors should be referred to psychosocial service providers specializing in cancer and trained to deliver empirically based interventions. Psychosocial resources that address fatigue may also be available through the National Cancer Institute (http://<a href=&quot;http://www.cancer.gov&quot; title=&quot;National Cancer Institute Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>www.cancer.gov</a>), the American Cancer Society (<a href=&quot;http://www.cancer.org&quot; title=&quot;American Cancer Society Web site&quot;>http://www.cancer.org</a>), LIVESTRONG (<a href=&quot;http://www.livestrong.org&quot; title=&quot;Livestrong WEb site&quot;>http://www.livestrong.org</a>), the Cancer Support Community (<a href=&quot;http://www.cancersupportcommunity.org/&quot; title=&quot;Cancer Support Community Web site&quot;>http://www.cancersupportcommunity.org/</a>), CancerCare (<a href=&quot;http://www.cancercare.org&quot; title=&quot;CancerCare Web site&quot;>http://www.cancercare.org</a>), Cancer.Net (<a href=&quot;http://www.cancer.net&quot; title=&quot;Cancer.Net Web site&quot;>http://www.cancer.net</a>), and the American Psychosocial Oncology Society (<a href=&quot;http://www.apos-society.org/survivors/helpline/helpline.aspx&quot; title=&quot;American Psychosocial Oncology Society Web site&quot;>http://www.apossociety.org/survivors/helpline/ helpline.aspx</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Mind-Body Interventions</strong></p>
<p>There is evidence from randomized trials that the following interventions may relieve fatigue in cancer survivors:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Mindfulness-based approaches </li>
    <li>Yoga </li>
    <li>Acupuncture </li>
</ul>
<p>The following interventions may also offer some benefit; however, additional research, particularly in the post-treatment period, is needed:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Biofield therapies (touch therapy), massage, music therapy, relaxation, reiki, and qigong </li>
    <li>Survivors should be referred to practitioners specializing in cancer and using protocols that have been empirically validated in cancer survivors. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pharmacologic Interventions</strong></p>
<p><em>Modified from NCCN Guideline for Cancer-Related Fatigue and NCCN Guideline for Survivorship</em></p>
<p>Evidence suggests that psychostimulants (e.g., methylphenidate) and other wakefulness agents (e.g., modafinil) can be effectively used to manage fatigue in patients with advanced disease or those receiving active treatment. However, there is limited evidence of their effectiveness in reducing fatigue in patients who are disease free after active treatment, outside of the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea.</p>
<p>Small pilot studies have evaluated the impact of supplements, such as ginseng and vitamin D, for cancer-related fatigue. However, there is no consistent evidence of their effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Ongoing Monitoring and Follow-Up</strong></p>
<p>Promote ongoing self-monitoring of fatigue levels, using a symptoms diary or other methods, because fatigue can be a late or long-term problem in post-treatment survivors.</p></div>"/>

<p>Because the literature search included in the pan-Canadian guideline was only current to 2009, an additional search was undertaken. The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were systematically searched by one reviewer from January 2009 to March 2013 using a combination of the following search terms: fatigue, cancer, survivor, post-treatment, late effects, and long-term effects. Reference lists of reviews were also extensively searched for studies on fatigue in the cancer survivor population. The located meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and randomized controlled trials were used as a supplementary evidence base for the recommendations and are cited where appropriate in the text.</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Search and ASCO Panel Content Review</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned, the adaptation process starts with a literature search to identify candidate guidelines for adaptation on a given topic. The systematic search of clinical practice guideline databases, guideline developer Web sites, and published health literature was conducted to identify clinical practice guidelines, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and other guidance documents addressing the screening, assessment, and care of cancer-related fatigue (see the Data Supplement [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field] for details of the search). On the basis of content review of the search yield, the ad hoc panel selected the pan-Canadian guideline on fatigue published in 2011, which is informed by recommendations from the Oncology Nursing Society and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). The panel also considered two NCCN Guidelines that had been created or updated since 2009. These guidelines were selected because they were comprehensive and recently developed by multidisciplinary panels of experts.</p></div>"/>

After a second review, the ASCO panel suggested that the more recent NCCN Guideline for Cancer-Related Fatigue and NCCN Guideline for Survivorship also be included in the adaptation. A methodologic review of the three guidelines was completed by two ASCO staff members using the Rigour of Development subscale of the AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II) instrument (<a href=&quot;http://www.agreetrust.org&quot; title=&quot;AGREE Trust Web site&quot;>www.agreetrust.org</a>).

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The guideline adaptation was informed by the ADAPTE methodology, which was used as an alternative to de novo guideline development for this guideline. Adaptation of guidelines is considered by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in selected circumstances, when one or more quality guidelines from other organizations already exist on the same topic. The objective of the ADAPTE process is to take advantage of existing guidelines to enhance efficient production, reduce duplication, and promote the local uptake of quality guideline recommendations.</p>
<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) adaptation process begins with a literature search to identify candidate guidelines for adaptation. Adapted guideline manuscripts are reviewed and approved by the ASCO Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC). The review includes two parts: methodologic review and content review. The methodologic review is completed by a member of the CPGC Methodology Subcommittee and/or by ASCO senior guideline staff. The content review is completed by an ad hoc panel (see Appendix Table A1 in the original guideline document) with guidance from an advisory group (see Appendix Table A2 in the original guideline document), convened by ASCO that includes multidisciplinary representation. Additional details on the methods used for the development of this guideline are reported in an online Methodology Supplement (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p>The Panel is led by two Co-Chairs who have the primary responsibility for the development and timely completion of the guideline adaptation. Recommendations from the source guidelines are extracted into a summary matrix (see Appendix II of the Methodology Supplement [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]).</p></div>"/>
