	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Questions and Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Among Patients Who Smoke, What Is the Impact of Efforts to Screen for the Presence of Lung Cancer on Smoking Behavior?</strong></p>
<p>The authors recommend that current smokers undergoing low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening be provided with cessation interventions that include counseling and pharmacotherapy (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Remark</em>: The act of screening alone is insufficient to promote smoking cessation.</p>
<p><em>Remark</em>: The use of self-help materials is insufficient in achieving an increased rate of smoking abstinence.</p>
<p>Among current smokers with demonstrated smoking related pulmonary disease, the authors recommend providing intensive cessation interventions (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Among Patients with Lung Cancer Undergoing Surgery, What Is the Best Approach to Smoking Cessation?</strong></p>
<p>Among lung cancer patients undergoing surgery, the authors recommend perioperative cessation pharmacotherapy as a method for improving abstinence rates (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).</p>
<p>Among lung cancer patients undergoing surgery for whom pharmacotherapeutic support is either contraindicated or refused, the authors suggest cessation counseling alone during the perioperative period (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).</p>
<p>Among lung cancer patients undergoing surgery, the timing of cessation does not appear to increase the risk of post-operative complications; the authors suggest that cessation interventions be initiated in the pre-operative period (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Remark</em>: Small observed effect sizes and limitations in experimental design do not justify delaying surgical procedures in favor of longer abstinence duration.</p>
<p>For lung cancer patients attempting cessation in conjunction with surgical interventions, the authors recommend initiating counseling and pharmacotherapy at the outset of surgical intervention (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Remark</em>: There is substantial evidence suggesting that reliance on short, low intensity cessation interventions such as advice to quit does not improve abstinence outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>What Is the Best Approach to Smoking Cessation Among Patients with Lung Cancer Undergoing Chemoradiotherapy?</strong></p>
<p>Among lung cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, the authors recommend cessation interventions that include counseling and pharmacotherapy to improve abstinence rates (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).</p>
<p>Among lung cancer patients with depressive symptoms, the authors suggest cessation pharmacotherapy with bupropion as a method to improve abstinence rates, depressive symptoms, and quality of life (QOL) (<strong>Grade 2B</strong>).</p>
<p>Among lung cancer patients for whom pharmacotherapeutic support is either contraindicated or refused, the authors suggest cessation counseling alone as a method to improve abstinence rates (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>What Is the Impact of Smoking Cessation on Patients with Lung Cancer Undergoing Radiation Therapy (RT)?</strong></p>
<p>Among lung cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy, the authors recommend cessation interventions that include counseling and pharmacotherapy (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>).</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>To develop this article, a literature review was conducted to identify available evidence within several databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Collaborative. Google Scholar was also used to identify relevant reviews and articles that may have contained references not retrieved by the database search. The search was structured around the following population, intervention, comparator, outcome (PICO) questions (see also Table S1 in the supporting data [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field):</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>

    <li>What is the best approach to smoking cessation among patients with lung cancer undergoing chemoradiotherapy? </li>
    <li>What is the impact of smoking cessation on patients with lung cancer undergoing radiation therapy (RT)? </li>
</ol>
<p>Expanded search terms were used to identify the evidence, including terms such as cancer, neoplasm, lung cancer, lung nodule, nicotine, smoking, smoking cessation, tobacco, tobacco dependence, diagnosis, chemotherapy, surgery, radiation, lung cancer treatment, and lung cancer screening. Search results were limited to those articles published from 1985 to present, relating to human subjects, and available in English. Initially, 989 unique citations met our search criteria. Following title screening for relevance, 568 unique relevant articles remained as candidates for inclusion in the evidence base, available for review by the authors. Study designs retained for this guideline included randomized controlled trials, cohort, case-control, secular trend, and case series. Each of the articles meeting inclusion criteria was then reviewed and mapped to the appropriate PICO question. An additional eight articles were identified by the authors through review of reference lists of primary reports and applicable review articles. Overall, 531 articles did not meet inclusion criteria, were found to be noninformative, or were no longer available, leaving a total of 37 articles for inclusion in the final evidence tables.</p></div>"/>

<p>Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were assessed using Documentation and Appraisal Review Tool (DART) (R. L. Diekemper; B. K. Ireland, MD; and L. R. Merz, PhD, MPH, DART, unpublished data, 2012), which was developed as an improved alternative to the existing tools for use in a clinical setting. However, this tool has been adopted for use in American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines and consensus statements since 2011.</p>
<p>Quality was assessed for each study as well as for the body of relevant evidence. Based on the population, intervention, comparator, and outcome (PICO) questions and volume of available literature, multiple study designs were included in the systematic reviews of the literature. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) primarily indicate benefits, but whenever observational studies met inclusion criteria they were often helpful in identifying harms. Observational studies were also examined when RCTs were not available to answer a particular PICO question. Allowing for multiple study designs resulted in the need for multiple quality assessment tools. Tools were chosen for assessing RCTs, observational studies, and diagnostic studies. The quality assessment tool for RCTs (R. L. Diekemper, B. K. Ireland, and L. R. Merz, unpublished data, 2012) was used for assessing the quality of RCTs, and a tool developed by the committee of the ninth edition of the Antithrombotics Guidelines was used for assessing the quality of observational studies. Diagnostic studies were assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS).</p>
<p><strong>Meta-analyses</strong></p>
<p>If a recently published good-quality meta-analysis was available, then it was used to inform the recommendations. When a good-quality meta-analysis was not available, guideline authors were encouraged to perform their own meta-analyses. Meta-analyses were performed when the data were fairly homogeneous. If a study was deemed poor quality, then it was not included in the pooled analysis. Heterogeneity of the pooled results was assessed using a <em>&amp;chi;</em><sup>2</sup> test and Higgins <em>I</em><sup>2</sup>, and a forest plot was examined for consistency of the results. The random effects model was chosen a priori as the appropriate model for pooling the data because it accounts for heterogeneity among the included studies. Results from the meta-analyses are available in the supplementary materials that can be downloaded from the Journal website under the corresponding article in the table of contents.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Panel Composition and Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>A call for applications to serve on the 3rd edition of the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Lung Cancer Guidelines (LC III) panel was put forth to the ACCP membership, to past panelists, and to other organizations that have previously endorsed earlier editions of these guidelines or appointed representatives to serve on those panels. Guiding the team was the LC III Executive Committee, composed of a Panel Chair, Vice Chair, Liaison to the Guidelines Oversight Committee (GOC), and two staff members, one serving as an adviser and the other as the lead methodologist. The GOC appointed the Liaison and the Chair, who was required to be free of conflicts of interest (COI). This Executive Committee provided general oversight and guidance; multiple reviews of research questions, article outlines, manuscripts, evidence tables, and other supporting documents; and facilitation of the final conference discussions and voting. As the scope was defined, content experts in each major area were identified to serve as topic editors and nominated by the Panel Chair to be advanced to the GOC for the requisite qualifications and COI review and approval process. These topic editors organized their research and writing teams, oversaw the work of the individual members, edited separate contributions into synthesized manuscripts, presented evidence at the final conference, and managed any of their committee members who were approved with management stipulations relevant to their COIs.</p>
<p>Each topic editor was initially charged with proposing individuals to support their topic committees with expertise in the content area and/or methodology. With the Chair's approval, these individuals were nominated for GOC reviews for COI and expertise. In some cases, GOC staff helped to locate additional methodologic support when it was determined to be necessary for various article committees. This resulted in an international panel of &amp;gt;100 multidisciplinary experts across 24 articles representing the fields of pulmonary medicine, critical care medicine, thoracic surgery, medical and radiation oncology, pathology, integrative medicine, primary care, health-care research, guidelines methodology, and epidemiology. Nineteen international organizations that are also dedicated to advancing research and practice in the area of lung cancer were invited to appoint representatives to this guideline project as adjunct participants. These individuals, unless already approved panelists, were not considered full voting members of the panel, since they had not been through the same ACCP COI review, but were included at the final conference, participated fully in the discussions, and provided external review and feedback on the manuscripts and supporting documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Formulating the Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>In most cases the topic editors, along with the other completely non-conflicted members of the article committee, formulated the recommendations. The summarized evidence tables and profiles (where profiles existed) provided the foundation for the recommendations. In formulating the recommendations, panelists considered not only the body of evidence but also the balance between the benefits and harms and considerations of other factors, such as cost or resource availability considerations and patient values and preferences, which might vary widely for some recommendations. These additional considerations are described in a Remarks section, which appears just below the relevant recommendation in the publication, each time the recommendation appears.</p>
<p><strong>Grading the Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Recommendations that are strong must be differentiated from those that are weak or weaker. Thus, the ACCP Grading System was used (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field), and the wording of the recommendations is explicit. This grading system has been used since 2005 and is based on two dimensions: the balance of benefits to harms and the quality of the evidence base. If the benefits clearly outweigh the harms or the harms clearly outweigh the benefits, the strength of the recommendation is considered strong and graded as a 1. In most cases, when there is strong confidence that the benefits outweigh the harms, most patients would choose the intervention endorsed in that recommendation. However, when the tradeoffs between desirable and undesirable consequences are not as clear, variability in patient preferences and values often becomes germane to the decision-making conversation.</p>
<p>Weak recommendations are those for which the benefits and harms are more equally balanced, and thus a clear choice is not as obvious; these are graded with a 2. Strong recommendations are phrased, &quot;the panel recommends,&quot; whereas weak recommendations are phrased &quot;the panel suggests.&quot; Accompanying these indications of the strength of a recommendation is a letter score (A, B, or C) representing the grading of the body of relevant literature.</p>
<p>In grading the quality of the evidence, RCTs start with a high score but might be downgraded to moderate or even low based on the following criteria: limitations in the study design or conduct of the trial, imprecision, indirectness relative to the specifics of the PICO question, inconsistency in the results, and risk of reporting bias. Observational studies, on the other hand, start off as low-level evidence but can be upgraded to moderate or even high if exceptionally large and consistent treatment effects increase confidence in the findings, especially if there is a strong dose-response gradient.</p>
<p>The final grades are combinations reflecting the strength of the recommendation and the quality of the evidence. Strong recommendations with high quality evidence, grade of 1A, are less common than in past editions of these guidelines, since the evidence is assessed with greater rigor for most topics, and few studies without important limitations are available.</p>
<p>However, recommendations that do attain this score are those for which the panel could state with confidence that new studies would be unlikely to change the direction of the effect. These recommendations apply to most patients in most circumstances. But as the grades decline, patient values and preferences likely would play an increasingly greater role in determining the best treatments or interventions for each patient.</p>
<p><strong>The Final Conference</strong></p>
<p>As the evidence reviews were completed and the tables and profiles prepared, the manuscripts and recommendations were drafted. Members of the article committees convened by phone or e-mail to discuss the evidence and work on drafting and grading the recommendations. These discussions generally resulted in agreement on both the quality of the evidence and strength of the recommendations.</p>
<p>The manuscripts and supporting tables were then reviewed by members of the Executive Committee and, after several iterations, the revised versions were shared among all panelists and the representatives of invited organizations in advance of the conference. The other panelists and representatives were asked not only to provide feedback but also to review the recommendations to identify any controversies. A recommendation was deemed to be controversial if at least one person disagreed with the wording or the grading, if there was controversy in practice, if there were wide variations in practice, or if at least one person asked that it be discussed among the broader panel and association representatives. These identified controversies composed the main agenda for the conference.</p>

<p>Once Executive Committee approval was received, the articles were submitted to American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) staff for several layers of review. All reviewers were required to undergo a full conflict of interest (COI) appraisal before being approved. In the first round of reviews, the Thoracic Oncology NetWork reviewed the content of the manuscripts and the members of the Guidelines Oversight Committee (GOC) assessed the manuscripts for adherence to the methodology and conformance with the evidence. The ACCP President also appointed members of the Board of Regents to evaluate the guidelines in depth. All comments were collated into spreadsheets to ensure that they were appropriately answered. GOC and board reviewers discussed each comment and determined which should be mandatory for the authors to amend and which were provided as suggestions for improvement. All reviews and comments were anonymous, and authors were required to respond to all mandatory issues either by revising the manuscripts or providing written justification explaining why they did not agree with the reviewers' comments.</p>
<p>The revised manuscripts were submitted for round II review, simultaneously with the Journal peer review. Once the GOC and board reviewers approved the manuscripts, the ACCP President, President Elect, President Elect Designee, and Immediate Past President reviewed the guidelines. Approval was granted pending confirmation from the Board of Regents, before submission to the journal for final review by the Journal Editor. In addition to this extensive review process, which included nearly 30 individual reviewers from the ACCP leadership, external organizations were provided with opportunities to provide feedback before, during, and just after the conference. This final version was submitted for consideration for endorsement to all of the invited organizations, whether or not they sent representatives to the conference. However, once the guidelines were approved by the ACCP Board of Regents, no further changes were accepted. Organizations that provided endorsements are listed in each article.</p></div>"/>

    <li>Although the ACCP is moving toward the production of evidence profiles for all guideline recommendations, there were many recommendations for which profiles were not developed, mostly because of resource constraints. When possible, methodologists created evidence profiles, and all panelists were educated on how to read and interpret them. The population, intervention, comparator, and outcome (PICO)-based systematic literature review process was followed for most recommendations, but there were some that could have benefited from meta-analyses. </li>
    <li>One limitation of all guidelines today is that they are not able to adequately address complex patients with multiple morbidities. This is largely because these patients are generally excluded from clinical trials and are often not included in observational studies. Since guidelines are reliant on evidence published in the peer-reviewed literature, the scientific foundation impedes the process of providing good guidance for these patients and is a limitation in these guidelines. Therefore, the ACCP encourages funding agencies to ensure that topics with limited evidence are addressed in future research. </li>

<p>These guidelines are widely disseminated through the <em>CHEST</em> journal publication, National Guideline Clearinghouse, and Guidelines International Network library. Additional clinical resources will soon be available to users of CHEST Evidence, an upcoming tool for searching the content of America College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines.</p>
<p>As the expanding research into diagnostic techniques and treatment options continues to evolve, the guidelines must be updated and kept current. This edition of the ACCP Lung Cancer Guidelines will be the last to be published as a complete collection, as the ACCP is now embarking on a new living guidelines model (LGM) for revising existing recommendations and developing new recommendations as the literature evolves. This will include a continual assessment of the currency of these recommendations relevant to new research studies as they are published. The review cycle for the ACCP Lung Cancer Guidelines will begin 1 year after publication unless the content experts who monitor the literature bring a recommendation or set of related recommendations to the attention of the Guideline oversight Committee (GOC), suggesting that those recommendations are in need of updating sooner. The new LGM will permit a more nimble approach to guideline development but also requires a point-of-care accessible vehicle, CHEST Evidence, for the users to readily search for the most current version. These features will be described in greater detail in upcoming publications. As a step in this direction, these guidelines will be published primarily online with a printed version of the Executive Summary, containing all of the recommendations, the introduction, and this article on methodology. All narratives for each article with their supporting tables, figures, and algorithms will be available online at <a href=&quot;http://journal.publications.chestnet.org&quot; title=&quot;Chest Journal Web site&quot;>journal.publications.chestnet.org</a>.</p></div>"/>
