	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The grade of evidence (<strong>I&amp;ndash;III</strong>) and level of recommendation (<strong>A&amp;ndash;C</strong>) are defined at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong>The following recommendations are based on good and consistent scientific evidence (Level A)</strong>:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>For women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) cytology test results, reflex human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is preferred. </li>
    <li>For women with HPV-positive ASC-US, whether from reflex HPV testing or co-testing, colposcopy is recommended. </li>
    <li>For women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cytology test results and no HPV test or a positive HPV test result, colposcopy is recommended. </li>
    <li>For women with a histologic diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2, CIN 3, or CIN 2,3 and adequate colposcopic examination, both excision and ablation are acceptable treatment modalities, except in pregnant women and young women. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The following recommendations are based on limited and inconsistent scientific evidence (Level B)</strong>:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>For women 30 years of age and older with HPV-positive but cytology-negative co-test results, repeat co-testing at 1 year is acceptable. For women with HPV-negative ASC-US, whether from reflex HPV testing or co-testing, repeat co-testing at 3 years is recommended. </li>
    <li>When colposcopy does not identify CIN in women with HPV-positive ASC-US, co-testing at 12 months is recommended. If the co-test result is HPV-negative and cytology negative, return for age-appropriate testing in 3 years is recommended. </li>
    <li>For women aged 21 to 24 years with ASC-US cytology test results, cytology testing alone at 12-month intervals is preferred, but reflex HPV testing is acceptable. </li>
    <li>For women aged 65 years and older, HPV-negative ASC-US test results should be considered abnormal when considering discontinuation of screening. </li>
    <li>For women aged 21 to 24 years with LSIL cytology test results, follow-up with cytology testing at 12-month intervals is recommended. Colposcopy is not recommended. </li>
    <li>For pregnant women with LSIL, colposcopy is preferred. </li>
    <li>For women with atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (ASC-H) cytology test results, colposcopy is recommended regardless of HPV result. Reflex HPV testing is not recommended. </li>
    <li>For women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cytology test results, immediate loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) or colposcopy is acceptable, except in special populations. </li>
    <li>A diagnostic excisional procedure is recommended for women with HSIL cytology test results when the colposcopic examination is inadequate, except during pregnancy. </li>
    <li>For women aged 21 to 24 years with ASC-H or HSIL test results, colposcopy is recommended. Immediate treatment (i.e., see-and-treat) is unacceptable. </li>
    <li>For women with all subcategories of atypical glandular cells (AGC) and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) except atypical endometrial cells, colposcopy with endocervical sampling is recommended regardless of HPV test result. Endometrial sampling is recommended in conjunction with colposcopy and endocervical sampling in women 35 years of age and older with all subcategories of AGC and AIS. Endometrial sampling is also recommended for women younger than 35 years with clinical indications that suggest they may be at risk of endometrial neoplasia. </li>
    <li>No further evaluation is recommended for asymptomatic premenopausal women with benign endometrial cells, endometrial stromal cells, or histiocytes. For postmenopausal women with benign endometrial cells, endometrial assessment is recommended regardless of symptoms. </li>
    <li>For women aged 25 years and older with CIN 1 or no lesion preceded by &quot;lesser abnormalities,&quot; co-testing at 1 year is recommended. If both the HPV test and cytology test results are negative, then age-appropriate retesting 3 years later is recommended. If all test results are negative, then return to routine screening is recommended. If any test result is abnormal, then colposcopy is recommended. If CIN persists for at least 2 years, either continued follow-up or treatment is acceptable. </li>
    <li>When CIN 1 is detected on endocervical sampling after lesser abnormalities but no CIN 2+ is detected colposcopically directed biopsies, management should follow American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) management guidelines for CIN 1, with the addition of repeat endocervical sampling in 12 months. </li>
    <li>For women aged 21 to 24 years with CIN 1 after an ASC-US or LSIL cytology test result, repeat cytology testing at 12-month intervals is recommended. Follow-up with HPV testing is unacceptable. </li>
    <li>Regardless of antecedent cytology test results, treatment of CIN 1 in women aged 21 to 24 years is not recommended. </li>
    <li>Treatment of pregnant women for CIN 1 is unacceptable. </li>
    <li>Hysterectomy is unacceptable as primary therapy for CIN 2, CIN 3, or CIN 2,3. </li>
    <li>For women treated for CIN 2, CIN 3, or CIN 2,3, co-testing at 12 months and 24 months is recommended. If both co-test results are negative, retesting in 3 years is recommended. If any test result is abnormal, colposcopy with endocervical sampling is recommended. If all test results are negative, routine screening is recommended for at least 20 years, even if this extends screening beyond 65 years of age. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The following recommendations are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (Level C)</strong>:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>For women with an unsatisfactory cytology test result and no, unknown, or a negative HPV test result, repeat cytology testing in 2 to 4 months is recommended. </li>
    <li>For women aged 21 to 29 years with negative cytology test results and absent or an insufficient endocervical&amp;ndash;transformation zone component, routine screening is recommended. For women aged 30 years and older with cytology test results reported as negative and with an absent or insufficient endocervical&amp;ndash;transformation zone component and no or unknown HPV test result, HPV testing is preferred. </li>
    <li>Acceptable options for the management of postmenopausal women with LSIL and no HPV test include obtaining HPV testing, repeat cytology testing at 6 months and 12 months, and colposcopy. </li>
    <li>For women aged 21 to 24 years with HSIL cytology test results, when CIN 2+ is not identified on histology testing, observation for up to 24 months using both colposcopy and cytology testing at 6-month intervals is recommended, provided the colposcopic examination is adequate and endocervical assessment is negative or CIN 1. </li>
    <li>When CIN 2+ is not identified on histologic testing, either a diagnostic excisional procedure or observation with co-testing at 12 months and 24 months is recommended, provided in the latter case that the colposcopic examination is adequate and the endocervical sampling is negative. In this circumstance, it is acceptable to review the cytologic, histologic, and colposcopic findings. </li>
    <li>For women aged 21 to 24 years with CIN 1 or no lesions after an ASC-H or HSIL cytology test result, observation for up to 24 months using both colposcopy and cytology testing at 6-month intervals is recommended, provided the colposcopic examination is adequate and endocervical assessment is negative. </li>
    <li>If CIN 2, CIN 3, or CIN 2,3 is identified at the margins of a diagnostic excisional procedure or in an endocervical sample obtained immediately after the procedure, reassessment using cytology testing with endocervical sampling at 4 to 6 months after treatment is preferred. </li>
    <li>For young women with a histologic diagnosis of CIN 2,3 not otherwise specified, either treatment or observation for up to 12 months using both colposcopy and cytology testing at 6-month intervals is acceptable, provided the colposcopy finding is adequate. When a histologic diagnosis of CIN 2 is specified for a young woman, observation is preferred but treatment is acceptable. Hysterectomy is preferred for women who have completed child-bearing and have a histologic diagnosis of AIS on a specimen from a diagnostic excisional procedure. </li>

    <li>Cytologic interpretation is subjective. Both the possibility of missed disease and the potential for overtreatment must be considered, and management must be individualized based on the patient's needs and future risks of high-grade disease and cancer. </li>
    <li>Some currently available human papillomavirus (HPV) tests lack a control for epithelial cellularity, so an HPV result may be falsely negative because of an insufficient sample. </li>
    <li>Excisional treatments for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) are associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery. </li>
    <li>For women who wish to maintain fertility, close observation after a deep conization is an option, but it carries a risk of persistent adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) of up to 10% and a small risk of cancer even when the cone excisional margins are negative. </li>
    <li>Endocervical curettage can cause laceration of the soft cervix with consequent hemorrhage or rupture the amniotic membranes. </li>
    <li>Biopsy during pregnancy has not been linked to fetal loss or preterm delivery, whereas failure to perform biopsies during pregnancy has been linked to missed invasive cancer. </li>
    <li>Different terminologies for biologically equivalent lesions created a potential for miscommunication among pathologists and clinicians and increased the risk of overtreating patients. </li>
    <li>Currently available management strategies cannot eliminate the risk of developing cancer, and attempts to completely eliminate risk often result in unanticipated harm from excessive evaluation and overtreatment. </li>

    <li>The information is designed to aid practitioners in making decisions about appropriate obstetric and gynecologic care. These guidelines should not be construed as dictating an exclusive course of treatment or procedure. Variations in practice may be warranted based on the needs of the individual patient, resources, and limitations unique to the institution or type of practice. </li>
    <li>There are several important principles in interpreting these guidelines. The revised guidelines were based on the best data available at the time of the 2012 consensus conference. Management strategies were developed based on risk where diagnoses with similar risk should have the same management. Clinical judgment is necessary in the application of these guidelines to individual patients. Currently available strategies cannot eliminate the risk of developing cancer, and attempts to completely eliminate risk often result in unanticipated harm from excessive evaluation and overtreatment. </li>
    <li>The guidelines apply to women identified with abnormalities during screening, and as with the 2006 guidelines, immunosuppressed women with abnormal results should be managed the same as immunocompetent women. Women with symptoms of a potential cervical disease require appropriate evaluation, which typically requires more than screening tests alone. In some instances, recommendations vary by age, particularly for 21 to 24 year olds. At other times, recommendations are specified for &quot;young women,&quot; a definition (see Table 1 in the original guideline document) intended to reflect an individual woman's desire to minimize the effect of treatment on future pregnancy, and does not specify any particular age. Women younger than 21 years should not undergo screening. If a woman younger than 21 years is inadvertently screened and has an abnormal test result, the result should not be ignored and should be managed based on the guidelines for 21 to 24-year-old women. </li>
