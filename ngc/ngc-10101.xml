<p>A member of the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) guideline development team (project coordinator) searched an established list of websites for guidelines and other relevant content published between 2004 and 2012. This list was compiled based on existing knowledge of evidence-based practice websites and recommendations from the literature. Detailed information about the search strategy for existing guidelines, including the list of websites searched and inclusion criteria, is available online at <a href=&quot;http://www.RNAO.ca&quot; title=&quot;RNAO Web site&quot;>www.RNAO.ca</a>. Guidelines were also identified by members of the RNAO expert panel. Members of the panel critically appraised nine international guidelines using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) Instrument II.</p>
<p><strong>Systematic Review</strong></p>
<p>Concurrent with the review of existing guidelines, a search for recent literature relevant to the scope of the guideline was conducted with guidance from the RNAO expert panel chair. The systematic literature search was facilitated by a health sciences librarian. The search, limited to English-language articles published between 2004 and 2012, was applied to Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), EMBASE, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.</p>
<p>A systematic review of the evidence based on the scope of the original guideline and supported by four clinical questions was conducted to capture the relevant literature and guidelines published between 2004 and 2012.</p>
<p>Two research assistants (Master's prepared nurses) independently assessed the eligibility of studies according to established inclusion/exclusion criteria. The RNAO Best Practice Guideline (BPG) Program Manager involved in supporting the RNAO expert panel resolved disagreements.</p>
<p>Detailed information about the search strategy for the systematic review, including the inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as search terms, is available online at <a href=&quot;http://www.RNAO.ca&quot; title=&quot;RNAO Web site&quot;>www.RNAO.ca</a>.</p></div>"/>

<p>The RNAO expert panel members were given a mandate to review the original guideline (March 2005) in light of the new evidence, specifically to ensure the validity, appropriateness and safety of the guideline recommendations. Where necessary, sections of the guideline have been updated based on new evidence. This current edition (2013) is the culmination of the RNAO expert panel's work in integrating the most current and best evidence to update the guideline recommendations and supporting evidence from the first edition.</p>
<p>In September 2012, the RNAO expert panel convened to achieve consensus on the need to update the original guideline recommendations and discussion of evidence. A review of the most recent literature and relevant guidelines published between 2004 and 2012 resulted in refinements to existing recommendations, as well as inclusion of stronger evidence for the recommendations. This second edition of the guideline is a culmination of the original work and the new literature.</p>
<p>The following research questions were established to guide the systematic review:</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Toolkit: Implementing Clinical Practice Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>Best practice guidelines (BPGs) can only be successfully implemented if there are adequate planning, resources, organizational and administrative supports, as well as appropriate facilitation. In this light, the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO), through a panel of nurses, researchers and administrators, has developed the <em>Toolkit: Implementation of Best Practice Guidelines</em> (2012). The <em>Toolkit</em> is based on available evidence, theoretical perspectives and consensus. The Toolkit is recommended for guiding the implementation of any clinical practice guideline in a health-care organization.</p>
<p>The <em>Toolkit</em> provides step-by-step directions to individuals and groups involved in planning, coordinating and facilitating the guideline implementation. These steps reflect a process that is dynamic and iterative rather than linear. Therefore, at each phase, preparation for the next phases and reflection on the previous phase is essential. Specifically, the <em>Toolkit</em> addresses the following key steps, as illustrated in the &quot;Knowledge to Action&quot; framework when implementing a guideline:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot;>
    <li>Identify problem: identify, review, select knowledge (Best Practice Guideline). </li>
    <li>Adapt knowledge to local context:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Assess barriers and facilitators to knowledge use </li>
        <li>Identify resources </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Select, tailor and implement interventions. </li>
    <li>Monitor knowledge use. </li>
    <li>Evaluate outcomes. </li>
    <li>Sustain knowledge use. </li>
</ol>
<p>Implementing guidelines that result in successful practice changes and positive clinical impact is a complex undertaking. The <em>Toolkit</em> is a key resource for managing this process and can be downloaded at <a href=&quot;http://rnao.ca/bpg&quot; title=&quot;RNAO Web site&quot;>http://rnao.ca/bpg</a> (see also the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation/Monitoring of Guideline</strong></p>
<p>Organizations implementing the recommendations in this nursing BPG are advised to consider how their implementation, and their impact, will be monitored and evaluated. The impact of BPG implementation and sustained use of evidence-based practice can be evaluated objectively through regular review of the utilization of the Nursing Order Sets and their effect on client health outcomes. Nursing Order Sets embedded within clinical information systems simplify this process by providing a mechanism for electronic data capture.</p>
<p>Table 8 in the original guideline document is based on a framework outlined in the <em>Toolkit: Implementation of best practice guidelines</em> (2012) and illustrates some specific indicators for monitoring and evaluation of the RNAO guideline <em>Assessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes</em> (2nd ed).</p>
<p><strong>Implementation Strategies</strong></p>
<p>Guideline implementation at the point of care is multifaceted and challenging at all levels. The uptake of knowledge in any practice setting requires more than the awareness and distribution of guidelines. Application of the guideline in any practice setting requires adaptation for the local context. Adaptation must be systematic and participatory to ensure recommendations are customized to fit the local context. The RNAO recommends the use of the <em>Toolkit: Implementation of Best Practice Guidelines</em> (2012), which provides an evidenced-informed process for a systematic, well-planned implementation.</p>
<p>The <em>Toolkit</em> is based on emerging evidence that the likelihood of achieving successful uptake of best practice in health care increases when:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Leaders at all levels are committed to support facilitation of guideline implementation </li>
    <li>Guidelines are selected for implementation through a systematic, participatory process </li>
    <li>Stakeholders relevant to the focus of the guideline are identified, and engaged in the implementation process </li>
    <li>An environmental readiness assessment for implementation is conducted for its impact on guideline uptake </li>
    <li>The guideline is tailored to the local context </li>
    <li>Barriers and facilitators to use of the guideline are assessed and addressed </li>
    <li>Interventions are selected that promote guideline use </li>
    <li>Guideline use is systematically monitored and sustained </li>
    <li>Evaluation of the impacts of guideline use is embedded into the process </li>
    <li>There are adequate resources to complete the activities related to all aspects of guideline implementation </li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Toolkit</em> uses the knowledge-to-action model that depicts the process of choosing a guideline in the centre triangle, and follows a detailed step-by-step direction for implementing guideline recommendations at the local level. These steps are illustrated in Figure 3 in the original guideline document: &quot;Knowledge to Action&quot; framework.</p></div>"/>
