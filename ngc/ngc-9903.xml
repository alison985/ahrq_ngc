<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Recommendations for Diagnosis and Treatment of Lumbar Disc Herniation with Radiculopathy</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis and Imaging</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>What history and physical examination findings are consistent with the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy?</em></strong></p>
<p>Manual muscle testing, sensory testing, supine straight leg raise, Lasegue's sign and crossed Lasegue's sign are recommended for use in diagnosing lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: A</em></p>
<p>The supine straight leg raise, as compared with the seated straight leg raise, is suggested for use in diagnosing lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: B</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of the cough impulse test, Bell test, hyperextension test, femoral nerve stretch test, slump test, lumbar range of motion or absence of reflexes in diagnosing lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p><strong><em>What are the most appropriate diagnostic tests (including imaging and electrodiagnostics), and when are these tests indicated in the evaluation and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy?</em></strong></p>
<p>There is a relative paucity of high quality studies on advanced imaging in patients with lumbar disc herniation. It is the opinion of the work group that in patients with history and physical examination findings consistent with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) be considered as the most appropriate, noninvasive test to confirm the presence of lumbar disc herniation. In patients for whom MRI is either contraindicated or inconclusive, computed tomography (CT) or CT myelography are the next most appropriate tests to confirm the presence of lumbar disc herniation.</p>
<p><em>Work Group Consensus Statement</em></p>
<p>In patients with history and physical examination findings consistent with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy, MRI is recommended as an appropriate, noninvasive test to confirm the presence of lumbar disc herniation.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: A</em></p>
<p>In patients with history and physical examination findings consistent with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy, CT scan, myelography and/or CT myelography are recommended as appropriate tests to confirm the presence of lumbar disc herniation.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: A</em></p>
<p>Electrodiagnostic studies may have utility in diagnosing nerve root compression though lack the ability to differentiate between lumbar disc herniation and other causes of nerve root compression. When the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy is suspected, it is the work group's opinion that cross-sectional imaging be considered the diagnostic test of choice and electrodiagnostic studies should only be used to confirm the presence of comorbid conditions.</p>
<p><em>Work Group Consensus Statement</em></p>
<p>Somatosensory evoked potentials are suggested as an adjunct to cross-sectional imaging to confirm the presence of nerve root compression but are not specific to the level of nerve root compression or the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: B</em></p>
<p>Electromyography, nerve conduction studies and F-waves are suggested to have limited utility in the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy. H-reflexes can be helpful in the diagnosis of an S1 radiculopathy, though are not specific to the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: B</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of thermal quantitative sensory testing or liquid crystal thermography in the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of motor evoked potentials or extensor digitorum brevis reflex in the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p><strong>Medical/Interventional Treatment</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>What is the role of pharmacological treatment in the management of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy?</em></strong></p>
<p>Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha inhibitors are not suggested to provide benefit in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: B</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of a single infusion of intravenous (IV) glucocorticosteroids in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor inhibitors in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of gabapentin in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of agmatine sulfate in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of amitriptyline in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p><strong><em>What is the role of physical therapy/exercise in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy?</em></strong></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of physical therapy/structured exercise programs as stand-alone treatments for lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p>In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the work group's opinion that a limited course of structured exercise is an option for patients with mild to moderate symptoms from lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Work Group Consensus Statement</em></p>
<p><strong><em>What is the role of spinal manipulation in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy?</em></strong></p>
<p>Spinal manipulation is an option for symptomatic relief in patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: C</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of spinal manipulation as compared with chemonucleolysis in patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p><em><strong>What is the role of traction (manual or mechanical) in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy?</strong></em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of traction in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence</em>)</p>
<p><strong><em>What is the role of contrast-enhanced, fluoroscopic guidance in the routine performance of epidural steroid injections for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy?</em></strong></p>
<p>Contrast-enhanced fluoroscopy is recommended to guide epidural steroid injections to improve the accuracy of medication delivery.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: A</em></p>
<p><strong><em>What is the role of epidural steroid injections (ESI) for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy?</em></strong></p>
<p>Transforaminal epidural steroid injection is recommended to provide short-term (2&amp;ndash;4 weeks) pain relief in a proportion of patients with lumbar disc herniations with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: A</em></p>
<p>Interlaminar epidural steroid injections may be considered in the treatment of patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: C</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the 12 month efficacy of transforaminal epidural steroid injection in the treatment of patients with lumbar disc herniations with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Is there an optimal frequency or quantity of injections for the treatment of lumbar disc herniations with radiculopathy?</em></strong></p>
<p>No evidence to address this question.</p>
<p><strong><em>Does the approach (interlaminar, transforaminal, caudal) influence the risks or effectiveness of epidural steroid injections in the treatment of lumbar disc herniations with radiculopathy?</em></strong></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the effectiveness of one injection approach over another in the delivery of epidural steroids for patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p><strong><em>What is the role of interventional spine procedures such as intradiscal electrothermal annuloplasty (IDEA) or intradiscal electrothermal therapy (IDET) and percutaneous discectomy (chemical or mechanical) in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy?</em></strong></p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><strong>Note</strong>: For the purpose of this guideline, the work group defined the following interventional spine procedures addressed in this clinical question:</p>
<ul class=&quot;contentListFont&quot; style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Percutaneous discectomy is defined as any discectomy procedure that does not require open dissection of the thoracolumbar fascia. This includes endoscopic discectomy. </li>
    <li>Endoscopic percutaneous discectomy is defined as a discectomy procedure in which access to the disc herniation is made with a portal, visualization of the discectomy is done with an endoscope, and removal of disc material is done with micro instruments or laser. This is an indirect visualization technique using the endoscope and fluoroscopic guidance. </li>
    <li>Automated percutaneous discectomy is defined as a discectomy procedure in which a cannula is inserted into the intervertebral disc space, usually with fluoroscopic guidance, and nuclear material is removed without direct visualization by nucleotome, laser or radiofrequency heat. This is an indirect visualization technique using the endoscope and fluoroscopic guidance. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of intradiscal ozone in the treatment of patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p>Endoscopic percutaneous discectomy may be considered for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: C</em></p>
<p>Endoscopic percutaneous discectomy is suggested for carefully selected patients to reduce early postoperative disability and reduce opioid use compared with open discectomy in the treatment of patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: B</em></p>
<p>Automated percutaneous discectomy may be considered for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: C</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of automated percutaneous discectomy compared with open discectomy in the treatment of patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>

<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of ultrasound or low power laser in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p><strong><em>What is the likelihood that a patient with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy undergoing medical/interventional treatment would have good/excellent functional outcomes at short (weeks&amp;ndash;six months), medium (six months&amp;ndash;two years) and long-term (greater than two years)?</em></strong></p>
<p>Medical/interventional treatment is suggested to improve functional outcomes in the majority of patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: B</em></p>
<p>Transforaminal epidural steroid injections are suggested to improve functional outcomes in the majority of patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>

<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of spinal manipulation to improve functional outcomes in patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Are there prognostic factors (e.g., age, duration or severity of symptoms) that make it more likely that a patient with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy will have good/excellent functional outcomes at short (weeks&amp;ndash;six months), medium (six months&amp;ndash;two years) and long-term (greater than two years) following medical/interventional treatment?</em></strong></p>
<p>Patient age (under 40 years of age) and a shorter duration of symptoms (less than three months) are associated with better outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy.</p>
<p><em>Level of Evidence: II</em></p>
<p>It is suggested that the type of lumbar disc herniation does not influence outcomes associated with transforaminal epidural steroid injections in patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Level of Evidence: II/III</em></p>
<p>It is suggested that a higher degree of nerve root compression negatively affects outcomes associated with transforaminal epidural steroid injections in patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Level of Evidence: II/III</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation regarding the influence of patient age on outcomes associated with medical/interventional treatment for patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p><em><strong>What is the cost-effectiveness of medical/interventional treatment options in the management of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy?</strong></em></p>
<p>The methodology for assessing level of evidence for studies of cost-effectiveness is not well-defined.</p>
<p><strong>Surgical Treatment</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Are there signs or symptoms associated with lumbar radiculopathy that predict a favorable surgical outcome?</em></strong></p>
<p>It is suggested that patients be assessed preoperatively for signs of psychological distress, such as somatization and/or depression, prior to surgery for lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy. Patients with signs of psychological distress have worse outcomes than patients without such signs.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: B</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the duration of symptoms prior to surgery affecting the prognosis for patients with cauda equina syndrome caused by lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p>It is suggested that patients be assessed using the preoperative straight leg raising test prior to surgery, as the presence of a positive straight leg raise test correlates with better outcomes from surgery for lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: B</em></p>
<p><strong><em>What is the role of epidural steroid injections or selective nerve root blocks in diagnosis or patient selection for subsequent surgical treatment of a lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy?</em></strong></p>
<p>No studies were available to directly address this question.</p>
<p><strong><em>When is the optimal timing for surgical intervention?</em></strong></p>
<p>Surgical intervention prior to six months is suggested in patients with symptomatic lumbar disc herniation whose symptoms are severe enough to warrant surgery. Earlier surgery (within six months&amp;ndash;one year) is associated with faster recovery and improved long-term outcomes.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: B</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against urgent surgery for patients with motor deficits due to lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Does discectomy (with or without preoperative medical/interventional treatment) result in better outcomes (clinical or radiographic) than medical/interventional treatment for lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy?</em></strong></p>
<p>Discectomy is suggested to provide more effective symptom relief than medical/interventional care for patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy whose symptoms warrant surgical intervention. In patients with less severe symptoms, surgery or medical/interventional care appear to be effective for both short- and long-term relief.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: B</em></p>
<p>In a select group of patients automated percutaneous lumbar discectomy (APLD) may achieve equivalent results to open discectomy, however, this equivalence is not felt to be generalizable to all patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy whose symptoms warrant surgery.</p>
<p><em>Level of Evidence: II/III</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of spinal manipulation as an alternative to discectomy in patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy whose symptoms warrant surgery.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Are there clinical circumstances in which lumbar fusion is appropriate in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy?</strong></em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against fusion for specific patient populations with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy whose symptoms warrant surgery.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Is there a difference in outcome (clinical or radiographic) or complications between different surgical approaches in the treatment of a lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy?</em></strong></p>
<p>When surgery is indicated, performance of sequestrectomy or aggressive discectomy is recommended for decompression in patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy since there is no difference in rates of reherniation.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: B</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the performance of aggressive discectomy or sequestrectomy for the avoidance of chronic low back pain in patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy whose symptoms warrant surgery.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p>Use of an operative microscope is suggested to obtain comparable outcomes to open discectomy for patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy whose symptoms warrant surgery.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: B</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of medial facetectomy to improve the outcomes for patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy whose symptoms warrant surgery.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the specific surgical approach for far lateral disc herniations in patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy whose symptoms warrant surgery.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of tubular discectomy compared with open discectomy to improve the outcomes for patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy whose symptoms warrant surgery.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><strong>Note</strong>: For purposes of this guideline, the work group defined tubular discectomy as a discectomy procedure in which a tubular retractor is used to access the herniation. This usually involves making a smaller incision than with a traditional open microdiscectomy procedure and involves direct visualization of the disc and or nerve roots by naked eye and or microscope/loupe magnification.</p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the application of glucocorticoids, with or without fentanyl, for short-term perioperative pain relief following decompression for patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy whose symptoms warrant surgery.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p>The application of glucocorticoids, with or without fentanyl, is not suggested to provide long-term relief of symptoms following decompression for patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy whose symptoms warrant surgery.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: B</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the application of a fat graft following open discectomy for patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy whose symptoms warrant surgery.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the addition of Oxiplex/SP gel or ADCON-L to discectomy for patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy whose symptoms warrant surgery.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p><strong><em>What are the medium-term (one to four years) and long-term (greater than&amp;nbsp;four years) results of surgical management of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy?</em></strong></p>
<p>The performance of surgical decompression is suggested to provide better medium-term (one to four years) symptom relief as compared with medical/interventional management of patients with radiculopathy from lumbar disc herniation whose symptoms are severe enough to warrant surgery.</p>
<p><em>Grade of Recommendation: B</em></p>
<p>Surgical decompression provides long-term (greater than&amp;nbsp;four years) symptom relief for patients with radiculopathy from lumbar disc herniation whose symptoms warrant surgery. It should be noted that a substantial portion (23%&amp;ndash;28%) of patients will have chronic back or leg pain.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Identification of Clinical Questions</strong></p>
<p>Trained guideline participants were asked to submit a list of clinical questions that the guideline should address. The lists were compiled into a master list, which was then circulated to each member with a request that they independently rank the questions in order of importance for consideration in the guideline. The most highly ranked questions, as determined by the participants, served to focus the guideline.</p>
<p><strong>Identification of Work Groups</strong></p>
<p>Multidisciplinary teams were assigned to work groups and assigned specific clinical questions to address. Because North American Spine Society (NASS) is comprised of surgical, medical and interventional specialists, it is imperative to the guideline development process that a cross section of NASS membership is represented on each group. This also helps to ensure that the potential for inadvertent biases in evaluating the literature and formulating recommendations is minimized.</p>
<p><strong>Identification of Search Terms and Parameters</strong></p>
<p>One of the most crucial elements of evidence analysis to support development of recommendations for appropriate clinical care is the comprehensive literature search. Thorough assessment of the literature is the basis for the review of existing evidence and the formulation of evidence-based recommendations. In order to ensure a thorough literature search, NASS has instituted a Literature Search Protocol (see Appendix E in the original guideline document) which has been followed to identify literature for evaluation in guideline development. In keeping with the Literature Search Protocol, work group members have identified appropriate search terms and parameters to direct the literature search.</p>
<p>Specific search strategies, including search terms, parameters and databases searched, are documented in the technical report that accompanies this guideline (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong>Completion of the Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>Once each work group identified search terms/parameters, the literature search was implemented by a medical/research librarian, consistent with the Literature Search Protocol.</p>
<p>Following these protocols ensures that NASS recommendations (1) are based on a thorough review of relevant literature; (2) are truly based on a uniform, comprehensive search strategy; and (3) represent the current best research evidence available. NASS maintains a search history in Endnote, for future use or reference.</p>
<p><strong>Review of Search Results/Identification of Literature to Review</strong></p>
<p>Work group members reviewed all abstracts yielded from the literature search and identified the literature they will review in order to address the clinical questions, in accordance with the Literature Search Protocol. Members have identified the best research evidence available to answer the targeted clinical questions. That is, if Level I, II and or III literature is available to answer specific questions, the work group was not required to review Level IV or V studies.</p></div>"/>

In order to systematically control for potential biases, at least two work group members have reviewed each article selected and independently assigned levels of evidence to the literature using the North American Spine Society (NASS) levels of evidence. Any discrepancies in scoring have been addressed by two or more reviewers. The consensus level (the level upon which two-thirds of reviewers were in agreement) was then assigned to the article.</p>
<p>As a final step in the evidence analysis process, members have identified and documented gaps in the evidence to educate guideline readers about where evidence is lacking and help guide further needed research by NASS and other societies.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Formulation of Evidence-based Recommendations and Incorporation of Expert Consensus</strong></p>
<p>Work groups held face-to-face meetings to discuss the evidence based answers to the clinical questions, the grades of recommendations and the incorporation of expert consensus. Expert consensus has been incorporated only where Level I&amp;ndash;IV evidence is insufficient and the work group has deemed that a recommendation is warranted. Transparency in the incorporation of consensus is crucial, and all consensus-based recommendations made in this guideline very clearly indicate that Level I&amp;ndash;IV evidence is insufficient to support a recommendation and that the recommendation is based only on expert consensus.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus Development Process</strong></p>
<p>Voting on guideline recommendations was conducted using a modification of the nominal group technique in which each work group member independently and anonymously ranked a recommendation on a scale ranging from 1 (&quot;extremely inappropriate&quot;) to 9 (&quot;extremely appropriate&quot;). Consensus was obtained when at least 80% of work group members ranked the recommendation as 7, 8 or 9. When the 80% threshold was not attained, up to three rounds of discussion and voting were held to resolve disagreements. If disagreements were not resolved after these rounds, no recommendation was adopted. After the recommendations were established, work group members developed the guideline content, addressing the literature which supports the recommendations.</p></div>"/>
