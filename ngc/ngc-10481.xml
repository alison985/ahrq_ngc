	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions for the rating of evidence (<strong>High, Intermediate, Low, Insufficient</strong>); types of recommendations (<strong>Evidence-Based, Formal Consensus, Informal Consensus, No Recommendation</strong>); and strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong, Moderate, Weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p>The following recommendations are evidence based, informed by generally small randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and guided by clinical experience. Ratings for benefits, harms, evidence quality, and recommendation strength are provided in Table 3 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Prevention of Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN)</strong></p>
<p>There are no established agents recommended for the prevention of CIPN in patients with cancer undergoing treatment with neurotoxic agents. This is based on the paucity of high-quality, consistent evidence and a balance of benefits versus harms.</p>
<p>Clinicians should not offer the following agents for the prevention of CIPN to patients with cancer undergoing treatment with neurotoxic agents:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) </li>
    <li>Amifostine </li>
    <li>Amitriptyline </li>
    <li>CaMg for patients receiving oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy </li>
    <li>Diethyldithio-carbamate (DDTC) </li>
    <li>Glutathione (GSH) for patients receiving paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy </li>
    <li>Nimodipine </li>
    <li>Org 2766 </li>
    <li>All-<em>trans</em>-retinoic acid </li>
    <li>Recombinant human leukemia inhibitory factor (RhuLIF) </li>
    <li>Vitamin E </li>
</ul>
<p>Venlafaxine is not recommended for routine use in clinical practice. Although the venlafaxine data resulted in some support for its utility, the data were not strong enough to recommend its use in clinical practice until additional supporting data become available.</p>
<p>No recommendations can be made on the use of <em>N</em>-acetylcysteine, carbamazepine, glutamate, GSH (for patients receiving cisplatin or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy), goshajinkigan (GJG), omega-3 fatty acids, or oxcarbazepine for the prevention of CIPN at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment of CIPN</strong></p>
<p>For patients with cancer experiencing CIPN, clinicians may offer duloxetine.</p>
<p>No recommendations can be made on the use of:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>ALC, noting that a positive phase III abstract supported its value, but this work has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, and a prevention trial suggested that this agent was associated with worse outcomes. </li>
    <li>Tricyclic antidepressants; however, based on the limited options that are available for this prominent clinical problem and the demonstrated efficacy of these drugs for other neuropathic pain conditions, it is reasonable to try a tricyclic antidepressant (e.g., nortriptyline or desipramine) in patients suffering from CIPN after a discussion with the patients about the limited scientific evidence for CIPN, potential harms, benefits, cost, and patient preferences. </li>
    <li>Gabapentin, noting that the available data were limited regarding its efficacy for treating CIPN. However, the panel felt that this agent is reasonable to try for selected patients with CIPN pain given (1) that only a single negative randomized trial for this agent was completed, (2) the established efficacy of gabapentin and pregabalin for other forms of neuropathic pain, and (3) the limited CIPN treatment options. Patients should be informed about the limited scientific evidence for CIPN, potential harms, benefits, and costs. </li>
    <li>A topical gel treatment containing baclofen (10 mg), amitriptyline HCL (40 mg), and ketamine (20 mg), noting that a single trial supported that this product did decrease CIPN symptoms. Given the available data, the panel felt that this agent is reasonable to try for selected patients with CIPN pain. Patients should be informed about the limited scientific evidence for the treatment of CIPN, potential harms, benefits, and costs. </li>

<p>Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to April week 2, 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 2013 week 16), and AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine; 1985 to April 2013) databases were searched for evidence reporting on outcomes of interest. Before the systematic search of the medical literature, an environmental scan was conducted for existing reviews regarding the management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). With no recent guidelines identified, older reviews with contents related to the clinical questions had their included studies cross-referenced to the guideline panel's literature search. Reference lists from other published seminal papers were scanned for additional citations. The literature search strategy is available in Appendix Table A3 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection Criteria</strong></p>

<p><strong>External Review</strong></p>
<p>A draft of the clinical practice guideline was reviewed by two Clinical Practice Guideline Committee members and 12 Survivorship Guideline Advisory Group members. In addition to providing comment and feedback, practitioners were asked to judge the evidence review and agreement with the recommendations. One additional reviewer was asked to assess the clarity of the recommendations and ease of implementation. The evidence review was rated as high quality, and there was high agreement with the substance of the recommendations.</p>
<p>The compounded topical baclofen-amitriptyline-ketamine gel was identified as having barriers to implementation. The product was created by one compounding pharmacy for a trial, and the combination is not US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved. Lack of insurance reimbursement for compounded products was also raised. Although not a recommended treatment, the statement regarding the topical gel as an option comes with a qualifier that specifies patients should be informed about the limited scientific evidence, potential harms, benefits, and costs.</p></div>"/>

The information addresses only the topics specifically identified therein and is not applicable to other interventions, diseases, or stages of diseases. This information does not mandate any particular course of medical care. Further, the information is not intended to substitute for the independent professional judgment of the treating provider, as the information does not account for individual variation among patients. Recommendations reflect high, moderate or low confidence that the recommendation reflects the net effect of a given course of action. The use of words like &quot;must,&quot; &quot;must not,&quot; &quot;should,&quot; and &quot;should not&quot; indicate that a course of action is recommended or not recommended for either most or many patients, but there is latitude for the treating clinician to select other courses of action in individual cases.

    <li>A number of nonpharmacologic interventions have been investigated for their role in preventing or treating peripheral neuropathy. However, the paucity of randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence prohibited inclusion of those studies in this systematic review. Moreover, the studies were often conducted in diabetic populations, with no specific focus on chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Nevertheless, several of the interventions have been tested in populations that included patients with cancer experiencing CIPN and, as such, merit further examination. </li>

<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and cancer survivors, and also to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network.
