	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p>What is the optimal treatment for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive advanced breast cancer?</p>
<p>For patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer:</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 1.A</strong></p>
<p>Is HER2-targeted therapy recommended for all patients in the first-line setting?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.A.I</em>. Clinicians should recommend HER2-targeted therapy&amp;ndash;based combinations for first-line treatment, except for highly selected patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive or progesterone receptor (PgR)-positive and HER2-positive disease, for whom clinicians may use endocrine therapy alone (see Clinical Question 2). Type: evidence based. Evidence quality: high. Strength of recommendation: strong.</p>
<p><em>Clinical Question 1.A.II</em></p>
<p>Is HER2-targeted therapy recommended for all patients in the second-line setting?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.A.II</em>. If a patient's HER2-positive advanced breast cancer has progressed during or after first-line HER2-targeted therapy, clinicians should recommend second-line HER2-targeted therapy&amp;ndash;based treatment. Type: evidence based. Evidence quality: high. Strength of recommendation: strong.</p>
<p><em>Clinical Question 1.A.III</em></p>
<p>Is HER2-targeted therapy recommended for all patients in the third-line setting and beyond?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.A.III</em>. If a patient's HER2-positive advanced breast cancer has progressed during or after second-line or greater HER2-targeted treatment, clinicians should recommend third-line or greater HER2-targeted therapy&amp;ndash;based treatment. Type: evidence based. Evidence quality: intermediate. Strength of recommendation: moderate.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 1.B</strong></p>
<p>Which HER2-targeted therapy (trastuzumab, lapatinib, pertuzumab, or trastuzumab emtansine [T-DM1]) with or without chemotherapy should be offered?</p>
<p><em>Clinical Question 1.B.I</em></p>
<p>What is the specific recommended regimen in the first-line setting?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.B.I</em>. Clinicians should recommend the combination of trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and a taxane for first-line treatment, unless the patient has a contraindication to taxanes. Type: evidence based. Evidence quality: high. Strength of recommendation: strong.</p>
<p><em>Clinical Question 1.B.II</em></p>
<p>What is the specific recommended regimen in the second-line setting?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.B.II</em>. If a patient's HER2-positive advanced breast cancer has progressed during or after first-line HER2-targeted therapy, clinicians should recommend T-DM1 as a second-line treatment. Type: evidence based. Evidence quality: high. Strength of recommendation: strong.</p>
<p><em>Clinical Question 1.B.III</em></p>
<p>What is the specific recommended regimen in the third-line setting and beyond?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.B.III.a</em>. If a patient's HER2-positive advanced breast cancer has progressed during or after second-line or greater HER2-targeted therapy, but she has not received T-DM1, clinicians should offer T-DM1. Type: evidence based. Evidence quality: high. Strength of recommendation: strong.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.B.III.b</em>. If a patient's HER2-positive advanced breast cancer has progressed during or after second-line or greater HER2-targeted treatment, but she has not received pertuzumab, clinicians may offer pertuzumab. Type: informal consensus. Evidence quality: insufficient. Strength of recommendation: weak.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.B.III.c</em>. If a patient's HER2-positive advanced breast cancer has progressed during or after second-line or greater HER2-targeted treatment, and she has already received pertuzumab and T-DM1, clinicians should recommend third-line or greater HER2-targeted therapy&amp;ndash;based treatment. Options include lapatinib plus capecitabine, as well as other combinations of chemotherapy and trastuzumab, lapatinib and trastuzumab, or hormonal therapy (in patients with ER-positive and/or PgR-positive disease). There is insufficient evidence to recommend one regimen over another. Type: informal consensus. Evidence quality: insufficient. Strength of recommendation: weak.</p>
<p><em>Clinical Question 1.B.IV</em></p>
<p>What is the optimal timing, dose, schedule, and duration of treatment?</p>
<p>The a priori clinical question for this guideline included optimal timing, dose, and schedule, but there was no specific evidence to inform the issues on optimal timing or dose; therefore, the guideline will not provide recommendations on these. Some conclusions, however, were drawn regarding duration.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.B.IV</em>. If a patient is receiving HER2-targeted therapy and chemotherapy combinations, the chemotherapy should continue for approximately 4 to 6 months (or longer) and/or to the time of maximal response, depending on toxicity and in the absence of progression. When chemotherapy is stopped, clinicians should continue the HER2-targeted therapy; no further change in the regimen is needed until the time of progression or unacceptable toxicities. Type: evidence based. Evidence quality: intermediate. Strength of recommendation: moderate.</p>
<p><em>Clinical Question 1.B.V</em></p>
<p>How should any previous HER2 adjuvant therapy influence treatment?</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 1.B.V.a</span></p>
<p>For patients with a recurrence &amp;le;12 months after adjuvant treatment?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.B.V.a</em>. If a patient finished trastuzumab-based adjuvant treatment &amp;le;12 months before recurrence, clinicians should follow the second-line HER2-targeted therapy&amp;ndash;based treatment recommendations (Recommendation 1.B.II). Type: evidence-based. Evidence quality: intermediate. Strength of recommendation: moderate.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 1.B.V.b</span></p>
<p>For patients with a recurrence &amp;gt;12 months after adjuvant treatment?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.B.V.b</em>. If a patient finished trastuzumab-based adjuvant treatment &amp;gt;12 months before recurrence, clinicians should follow the first-line HER2-targeted therapy&amp;ndash;based treatment recommendations (Recommendation 1.B.I). Type: evidence based. Evidence quality: high. Strength of recommendation: strong.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p>For patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer that is also ER positive (&amp;plusmn;PgR positive), does ER/PgR status influence decisions about the following:</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 2.A</strong></p>
<p>What is the most appropriate first-line therapy for patients with HER2-positive, ER-positive (PgR positive or negative) advanced breast cancer?</p>
<p>If a patient's cancer is hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive, clinicians may recommend either:</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.A.I</em>. HER2-targeted therapy plus chemotherapy. Type: evidence based. Evidence quality: high. Strength of recommendation: strong.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.A.II</em>. Endocrine therapy plus trastuzumab or lapatinib (in selected cases). Type: evidence based. Evidence quality: high. Strength of recommendation: moderate.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.A.III</em>. Endocrine therapy alone (in selected cases; see Recommendation 2.C). Type: evidence based. Evidence quality: intermediate. Strength of recommendation: weak.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 2.B</strong></p>
<p>If a clinician plans to offer endocrine therapy at some point during a woman's treatment, what is the appropriate sequencing?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.B</em>. If the patient has started with a HER2-positive targeted therapy and chemotherapy combination, clinicians may add endocrine therapy to the HER2-targeted therapy when chemotherapy ends and/or when the cancer progresses. Type: informal consensus. Evidence quality: insufficient. Strength of recommendation: weak.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 2.C</strong></p>
<p>Can clinicians offer first-line endocrine therapy? If so, should it always be in combination with HER2-targeted therapy?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.C</em>. In special circumstances, such as low disease burden, presence of comorbidities (contradictions to HER2-targeted therapy, such as congestive heart failure), and/or presence of a long disease-free interval, clinicians may offer first-line endocrine therapy alone. Type: informal consensus. Evidence quality: intermediate. Strength of recommendation: weak.</p>

    <li>There are some contraindications to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapy, as a result of its cardiovascular toxicity effects (see Table 4 in the original guideline document). The single most important contraindication is a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and/or clinical evidence of congestive heart failure arising from low LVEF. Among patients with congestive heart failure or low ejection fraction, the decision to use HER2-targeted therapy must be made on an individual basis, assessing the relative risks of cardiac dysfunction from a specific regimen versus disease progression. Therefore, the Expert Panel recommended that clinicians treat patients with clinical congestive heart failure or compromised LVEF on a case-by-case basis, assessing the relative risks of cardiac dysfunction versus disease progression. </li>
    <li>Because the CLEOPATRA (Clinical Evaluation of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab) regimen used a taxane, contraindications to the regimen included any contraindications to the use of a taxane, such as neuropathy, prior taxane hypersensitivity, and so on (see drug labels for other contraindications). The Data Supplement (see the &quot;Availability of Companions Documents&quot; field) provides further information. </li>

    <li>The clinical practice guideline and other guidance published herein are provided by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) to assist providers in clinical decision making. The information herein should not be relied on as being complete or accurate, nor should it be considered as inclusive of all proper treatments or methods of care or as a statement of the standard of care. With the rapid development of scientific knowledge, new evidence may emerge between the time information is developed and when it is published or read. The information is not continually updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence. The information addresses only the topics specifically identified herein and is not applicable to other interventions, diseases, or stages of diseases. This information does not mandate any particular course of medical care. Furthermore, the information is not intended to substitute for the independent professional judgment of the treating provider, because the information does not account for individual variation among patients. Each recommendation reflects high, moderate, or low confidence that the recommendation reflects the net effect of a given course of action. The use of words like must, must not, should, and should not indicates that a course of action is recommended or not recommended for either most or many patients, but there is latitude for the treating physician to select other courses of action in individual cases. In all cases, the selected course of action should be considered by the treating provider in the context of treating the individual patient. Use of the information is voluntary. ASCO provides this information on an as-is basis and makes no warranty, express or implied, regarding the information. ASCO specifically disclaims any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular use or purpose. ASCO assumes no responsibility for any injury or damage to persons or property arising out of or related to any use of this information or for any errors or omissions. </li>
    <li>Because many patients for whom guideline recommendations apply present with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs), any management plan needs to take into account the complexity and uncertainty created by the presence of MCCs and highlight the importance of shared decision making around guideline use and implementation. Therefore, in consideration of recommended care for the target index condition, clinicians should review all other chronic conditions present in the patient and take those conditions into account when formulating treatment and follow-up plans (common chronic conditions for patients with breast cancer are listed in Data Supplement 5 [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot;]). Taking these considerations into account, practice guidelines should provide information on how to apply the recommendations for patients with MCCs, perhaps as a qualifying statement for recommended care. This may mean that some or all of the recommended care options are modified or not applied, as determined by best practice in consideration of any MCC. </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Guideline Implementation</strong></p>
<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed to be implemented in a variety of health settings. Barriers to implementation and application of the guideline recommendations include factors such as the need to increase awareness among front-line practitioners and cancer survivors and also the need to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources.</p>
<p>This guideline does not consider cost-effectiveness analyses. The agents in this guideline are FDA approved and available; however, cost is an issue that may be appropriate to discuss with patients, because copayments and other expenses are insurance dependent and/or financial assistance may be available. Unfortunately, there are parts of the country where access to a medical oncologist might be limited, and because of reimbursement issues, some smaller practices are referring elsewhere for expensive treatments. There is also the issue of the uninsured who do not qualify for Medicaid or other financial assistance. ASCO provides resources on cost of care for your patient. Most practicing oncologists in the United States have used trastuzumab and lapatinib and are starting to gain experience with pertuzumab and trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). As with all new treatments, diffusion in the community must occur in time.</p>
<p>The guideline <em>Bottom Line</em> was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will also be distributed through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network and other ASCO communications. ASCO guidelines are posted on the ASCO Web site and most often published in the <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO)</em>.</p>
<p>For more information on the ASCO implementation strategy, please see the <a href=&quot;http://www.asco.org/institute-quality/implementation-strategy&quot; title=&quot;ASCO Web site&quot;>ASCO Web site</a>.</p></div>"/>
