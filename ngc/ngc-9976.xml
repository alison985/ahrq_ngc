	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions of the levels of the recommendations (<strong>A, B, C, U</strong>) and classification of the evidence (<strong>Class I-IV</strong>) are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Is Withdrawal of Dopamine Receptor Blocking Agents (DRBAs) an Effective Tardive Syndrome (TDS) Treatment?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion and Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Data are insufficient to support or refute TDS treatment by DRBA withdrawal (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Context</strong></p>
<p>The American Psychiatric Association Task Force recommends antipsychotic withdrawal only in patients who can tolerate it. Despite limited evidence, clinical impression indicates that short-term withdrawal may worsen dyskinesias, whereas adding antipsychotics with stronger extrapyramidal symptoms can reduce TDS. Psychotic relapse predictors include younger age, higher baseline antipsychotic dosage, and shorter hospitalization.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Does Switching from Typical to Atypical DRBAs Reduce TDS Symptoms?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion and Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Data are insufficient to support or refute TDS treatment by changing to atypical antipsychotics (<strong>Level U, Class IV studies</strong>).</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>What Is the Efficacy of Pharmacologic Agents in Treating TDS?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Acetazolamide and Amantadine</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<p>Acetazolamide and thiamine reduced TDS in one Class III study. Amantadine reduced TDS when used conjointly with a neuroleptic during the first 7 weeks (<strong>1 Class II study, 2 Class III studies</strong>). </p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<p>Data are insufficient to support or refute TDS treatment with acetazolamide and thiamine (<strong>Level U</strong>). Amantadine with neuroleptics may be considered to treat TDS for short-term use (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Clinical Context</em></p>
<p>Only flupentixol decanoate, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, trifluoperazine, and thioridazine were tested with amantadine in these studies. The efficacy of amantadine plus other neuroleptics in TDS treatment is unknown. Because safety data are unavailable concerning long-term use of only typical neuroleptics as TDS suppressive agents and because of these agents' propensity to cause TDS, the evidence suggests only potential efficacy short-term.</p>
<p><strong>First-Generation Antipsychotics</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<p>Haloperidol possibly reduces TDS movements for up to 2 weeks (<strong>2 Class II studies, 1 Class III study</strong>) but is associated with increased akinetic-rigid syndrome (<strong>1 Class II study</strong>). Data are insufficient to support or refute the use of thiopropazate in reducing oral dyskinesia (<strong>1 Class III study</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<p>Data are insufficient to support or refute the use of thiopropazate, molindone, sulpiride, fluperlapine, and flupenthixol in treating TDS (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Clinical Context</em></p>
<p>Although haloperidol and thiopropazate possibly reduce TDS, they are not recommended because of the competing risk of akinetic-rigid syndrome. Safety data are unavailable concerning long-term use of typical antipsychotics as TDS suppressive agents, and these drugs themselves can cause TDS; these significant risks outweigh the benefits of any short-term use of typical antipsychotics.</p>
<p><strong>Second-Generation Antipsychotics: Clozapine, Risperidone, Olanzapine, and Other Agents</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<p>Data are conflicting regarding the use of clozapine (<strong>conflicting Class III studies</strong>). Risperidone (<strong>2 Class II studies, 1 Class III study</strong>) is probably effective in reducing tardive dyskinesia (TDD). Olanzapine is possibly effective in reducing TDD (<strong>2 Class III studies</strong>). The safety of risperidone and olanzapine as a TDS suppressant for use beyond 48 weeks has not been addressed.</p>
<p>There is no evidence to determine the efficacy of quetiapine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole, and sertindole in TDS treatment.</p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<p>Because neuroleptic agents may themselves cause TDS and may mask its symptoms rather than treat it, these drugs cannot be recommended for TDS treatment (<strong>Level U</strong>). Caution is advised when using risperidone or olanzapine to reduce TDS.</p>
<p><strong>Electroconvulsive Therapy</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion and Recommendation</em></p>
<p>Data are insufficient to determine the efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy for TDD treatment (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Dopamine-Depleting Agents: Tetrabenazine, Reserpine, and &amp;alpha;-Methyldopa</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<p>Tetrabenazine (TBZ) possibly reduces TDS symptoms (<strong>2 consistent Class III studies</strong>). One study (<strong>Class III</strong>) found reserpine and &amp;alpha;-methyldopa effective in treating TDS.</p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<p>TBZ may be considered in treating TDS (<strong>Level C</strong>). Data are insufficient to determine the efficacy of reserpine or &amp;alpha;-methyldopa in treating TDS (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Clinical Context</em></p>
<p>TBZ reduces TDS symptoms; there is no evidence that long-term TBZ administration induces TDS, but it can cause parkinsonism.</p>
<p><strong>Dopamine Agonists</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion and Recommendation</em></p>
<p>Data are insufficient to support or refute the use of bromocriptine for TDS treatment (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Cholinergic Drugs</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>Galantamine is possibly ineffective in treating TDS (<strong>1 Class II study</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<p>Galantamine might not be considered in treating TDS (<strong>Level C</strong>). Data are insufficient to determine the effectiveness of other cholinergic drugs in treating TDS (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Anticholinergic Drugs</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion and Recommendation</em></p>
<p>Data are insufficient to determine the effectiveness of anticholinergic drugs in treating TDS (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Biperiden (Akineton) Discontinuation</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion and Recommendation</em></p>
<p>Data are insufficient to determine the effectiveness of biperiden discontinuation in treating TDS (<strong>Level U, 1 Class III study</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Antioxidants</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions and Recommendations</em></p>
<p>EGb-761 is probably useful in TDS treatment (<strong>1 Class I study</strong>), but data are limited to inpatients with schizophrenia (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p>Based on 4 Class II and numerous Class III studies, data are conflicting regarding vitamin E efficacy in treating TDS. Data are insufficient to determine the efficacy of vitamin E (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p>Based on 1 Class II study, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is possibly ineffective in treating TDS and might not be considered (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p>Melatonin is possibly ineffective in treating TDS at a 2-mg/d dose (<strong>1 Class II study</strong>) but is possibly effective in treating TDS at a 10-mg/d dose (<strong>1 Class II study</strong>). Evidence regarding TDS treatment with melatonin is conflicting (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p>Data are insufficient to support or refute the use of other antioxidants, including vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, selegiline, and yi-gan san, in treating TDS (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><em>&amp;gamma;</em>-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) Agonists</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions and Recommendations</em></p>
<p>Based on 1 Class I study, clonazepam is probably effective in decreasing TDD symptoms short-term (approximately 3 months) and should be considered for short-term TDD treatment (<strong>Level B</strong>). Data are insufficient to support or refute baclofen use in treating TDD (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Levetiracetam</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion and Recommendation</em></p>
<p>Data are insufficient to recommend levetiracetam as TDS treatment (<strong>Level U, 1 Class III study</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Calcium Channel Blockers</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions and Recommendations</em></p>
<p>Data are insufficient to support or refute nifedipine use in treating TDD (<strong>Level U</strong>). Diltiazem probably does not reduce TDD and should not be considered as treatment (<strong>Level B, 1 Class I study</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Buspirone</strong></p>

<p><strong>Classification of Evidence for Therapeutic Articles</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: A randomized, controlled clinical trial of the intervention of interest with masked or objective outcome assessment, in a representative population. Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences.</p>
<p>The following are also required:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
    <li>Concealed allocation </li>
    <li>Primary outcome(s) clearly defined </li>
    <li>Exclusion/inclusion criteria clearly defined </li>
    <li>Adequate accounting for dropouts (with at least 80% of enrolled subjects completing the study) and crossovers with numbers sufficiently low to have minimal potential for bias. </li>
    <li>For noninferiority or equivalence trials claiming to prove efficacy for one or both drugs, the following are also required*
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot;>
        <li>The authors explicitly state the clinically meaningful difference to be excluded by defining the threshold for equivalence or noninferiority. </li>
        <li>The standard treatment used in the study is substantially similar to that used in previous studies establishing efficacy of the standard treatment (e.g., for a drug, the mode of administration, dose and dosage adjustments are similar to those previously shown to be effective). </li>
        <li>The inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient selection and the outcomes of patients on the standard treatment are comparable to those of previous studies establishing efficacy of the standard treatment. </li>
        <li>The interpretation of the results of the study is based upon a per protocol analysis that takes into account dropouts or crossovers. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: A randomized, controlled clinical trial of the intervention of interest in a representative population with masked or objective outcome assessment that lacks one criterion from a&amp;ndash;e above or a prospective matched cohort study with masked or objective outcome assessment in a representative population that meets b&amp;ndash;e above. Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: All other controlled trials (including well-defined natural history controls or patients serving as own controls) in a representative population, where outcome is independently assessed, or independently derived by objective outcome measurement.**</p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong>: Studies not meeting Class I, II or III criteria including consensus or expert opinion.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*Note that numbers 1&amp;ndash;3 in Class Ie are required for Class II in equivalence trials. If any one of the three is missing, the class is automatically downgraded to Class III.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>**Objective outcome measurement: an outcome measure that is unlikely to be affected by an observer's (patient, treating physician, investigator) expectation or bias (e.g., blood tests, administrative outcome data).</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.)*</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an &quot;A&quot; recommendation if 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &amp;gt;5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &amp;gt;2).</p></div>"/>

<p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is committed to producing independent, critical, and truthful clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Significant efforts are made to minimize the potential for conflicts of interest to influence the recommendations of this CPG. To the extent possible, the AAN keeps separate those who have a financial stake in the success or failure of the products appraised in the CPGs and the developers of the guidelines. Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee prior to project initiation. AAN limits the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest. The AAN forbids commercial participation in, or funding of, guideline projects. Drafts of the guideline have been reviewed by at least 3 AAN committees, a network of neurologists, <em>Neurology</em>&amp;reg; peer reviewers, and representatives from related fields.
