<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Early closed reduction of cervical spinal fracture/dislocation injuries with craniocervical traction for the restoration of anatomic alignment of the cervical spine in awake patients is recommended. </li>
    <li>Closed reduction in patients with an additional rostral injury is not recommended. </li>
    <li>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended for patients with cervical spinal fracture dislocation injuries if they cannot be examined during closed reduction because of altered mental status or before either anterior or posterior surgical procedures when closed reduction has failed. Prereduction MRI performed in patients with cervical fracture dislocation injuries will demonstrate disrupted or herniated intervertebral disks in one-third to one-half of patients with facet subluxation injuries. These findings do not appear to influence outcome following closed reduction in awake patients, and therefore, the utility of prereduction MRI in this circumstance is uncertain. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Summary</span></strong></p>
<p>In the data derived from the literature published to date, closed reduction of fracture/dislocation injuries of the cervical spine by traction-reduction appears to be safe and effective for the reduction of acute traumatic spinal deformity in awake patients. Approximately 80% of patients will have their cervical fracture dislocation injuries reduced with this technique. The overall permanent neurological complication rate of closed reduction is approximately 1%. The associated risk of a transient injury with closed reduction appears to be 2% to 4%. Closed traction-reduction appears to be safer than manipulation under anesthesia (MUA).</p>
<p>There are numerous causes of neurological deterioration in patients who harbor unstable cervical spinal injuries. These include inadequate immobilization, unrecognized rostral injuries, overdistraction, loss of reduction, and cardiac, respiratory, and hemodynamic instability. Therefore, an appropriately trained specialist must supervise the treatment, including attempted closed reduction, of patients with cervical spine fracture dislocation injuries.</p>
<p>Although prereduction MRI will demonstrate disk herniation in up to half of patients with acute cervical spinal facet subluxation injuries, the clinical importance of these findings is unknown. Only 2 case reports were found that document neurological deterioration caused by disk herniation following successful closed traction reduction. In addition, several investigators have demonstrated the lack of correlation between the MRI findings of disk herniation and neurological deterioration in this patient population. The use of prereduction MRI has therefore not been shown to improve the safety or efficacy of closed traction-reduction of patients with acute cervical fracture dislocation injuries. MRI before fracture/dislocation reduction may unnecessarily delay spinal column realignment for decompression of the spinal cord. There is <strong>Class III</strong> medical evidence that supports early closed reduction of cervical fracture/dislocation injuries with respect to neurological recovery. Prereduction MRI in this setting is not necessary. The ideal timing of closed reduction of cervical spinal fracture dislocation injuries is unknown, but many investigators favor reduction as rapidly as possible after injury to maximize the potential for neurological recovery.</p>
<p>Patients who fail attempted closed reduction of cervical fracture injuries have a higher incidence of anatomic obstacles to reduction, including facet fractures and disk herniations. Patients who fail closed reduction should undergo more detailed radiographic study/MRI before attempts at open reduction. The presence of a significant disk herniation in this setting is a relative indication for an anterior decompression procedure, either in lieu of or preceding a posterior procedure.</p>
<p>Patients with cervical fracture dislocation injuries who cannot be examined because of head injury or intoxication cannot be assessed for neurological deterioration during attempted closed reduction. For this reason, an MRI before attempted reduction (open or closed) is recommended as a treatment option on the basis of <strong>Class III</strong> medical evidence.</p>

<p>To add to and update the previously analyzed medical evidence on this issue, a new National Library of Medicine (PubMed) computerized literature search was performed. Medical subject headings queried included &quot;facet dislocation&quot; or &quot;fracture&quot; or &quot;dislocation&quot; and &quot;cervical spine.&quot; This search resulted in 6705 citations. This search was combined with the term &quot;reduction,&quot; yielding 527 potential citations. English language citations with abstracts limited to human subjects yielded 380 potential references. Restricting the search to 2001 to 2011 further refined the results to 155 citations. The abstracts of each of these citations were reviewed. As before, clinical series dealing with adult patients in the acute setting were selected. Case reports and case collections were included. Additional references were culled from the reference lists of the articles reviewed. Nine additional articles with clinical data germane to the issue of closed reduction of cervical spinal fractures were identified. These articles are summarized in the text, provided in Evidentiary Table format (refer to the Table in the original guideline document), and included in the bibliography.</p>
<p>As observed in the previous medical evidence-based review, there were no randomized clinical trials, no prospective cohort studies, and no case-control studies. The publications identified consisted of case series of patients with acute or subacute unilateral or bilateral cervical facet dislocation injuries and provide Class III medical evidence. In contrast to the original spinal cord injury guidelines publication, no report of permanent neurological deterioration following or resulting from closed reduction of a cervical spinal fracture injury has been published since 2000.</p></div>"/>

Of the 11 patients reported to develop new permanent neurological deficits with attempted closed reduction, 2 had root injuries, and 2 had ascending spinal cord deficits noted at the time of reduction. Seven patients were noted to have decreased American Spinal Injury Association motor scores after reduction; however, neither the nature nor the cause of the new deficits in these patients was described. </li>
    <li>Transient neurological deterioration following closed reduction has also been reported with an incidence between 2% and 4%. Before 2001, temporary deficits were described in 20 patients of 1200 reported. These deficits reversed spontaneously or improved following reduction of weight or following open reduction. The causes of neurological deterioration associated with closed reduction in these and other series included overdistraction, failure to recognize a more rostral noncontiguous lesion, disk herniation, epidural hematoma, and spinal cord edema. </li>

    <li>Medical evidence-based guidelines are not meant to be restrictive or to limit a clinician's practice. They chronicle multiple successful treatment options (for example) and stratify the more successful and the less successful strategies based on scientific merit. They are not absolute, &quot;must be followed&quot; rules. This process may identify the most valid and reliable imaging strategy for a given injury, for example, but because of regional or institutional resources, or patient co-morbidity, that particular imaging strategy may not be possible for a patient with that injury. Alternative acceptable imaging options may be more practical or applicable in this hypothetical circumstance. </li>
    <li>Guidelines documents are not tools to be used by external agencies to measure or control the care provided by clinicians. They are not medical-legal instruments or a &quot;set of certainties&quot; that must be followed in the assessment or treatment of the individual pathology in the individual patients we treat.
