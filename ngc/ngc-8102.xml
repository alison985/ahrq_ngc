	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

    <li>Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) should be considered superior to non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan for the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke in patients presenting within 12 hours of symptom onset (<strong>Level A</strong>). </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the value of perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) in diagnosing acute ischemic stroke (<strong>Level U</strong>). </li>
    <li>Baseline DWI volume should be considered useful in predicting baseline clinical stroke severity and final lesion volume in anterior-circulation stroke syndromes (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Baseline DWI volume may be considered not useful in predicting baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score in posterior-circulation stroke syndromes (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Baseline DWI volume may be considered useful in predicting clinical outcome as measured by the NIHSS and Barthel Index (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>

<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Definitions</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.)*</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an &quot;A&quot; recommendation if 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &amp;gt;5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &amp;gt;2).</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Evidence for Diagnostic Tests</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: A cohort study with prospective data collection of a broad spectrum of persons with the suspected condition, using an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The diagnostic test is objective or performed and interpreted without knowledge of the patient's clinical status. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: A case control study of a broad spectrum of persons with the condition established by an acceptable reference standard compared to a broad spectrum of controls or a cohort study where a broad spectrum of persons with the suspected condition where the data was collected retrospectively. The diagnostic test is objective or performed and interpreted without knowledge of disease status. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: A case control study or cohort study where either persons with the condition or controls are of a narrow spectrum. The condition is established by an acceptable reference standard. The reference standard and diagnostic test are objective or performed and interpreted by different observers. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong>: Studies not meeting Class I, II or III criteria including consensus, expert opinion or a case report.</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Evidence for Prognostic Articles</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: A cohort study of a broad spectrum of persons at risk for developing the outcome (e.g., target disease, work status). The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who is masked to the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of prognostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: A case control study of a broad spectrum of persons with the condition compared to a broad spectrum of controls or a cohort study of a broad spectrum of persons at risk for the outcome (e.g., target disease, work status) where the data was collected retrospectively. The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who is masked to the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of prognostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: A case control study or a cohort study where either the persons with the condition or the controls are of a narrow spectrum where the data was collected retrospectively. The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who did not determine the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of a prognostic accuracy.</p>

<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot;>
    <li>Are diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) sensitive and specific in the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke (compared to concurrent imaging with other techniques, established by follow-up imaging, clinical follow-up, and final discharge diagnosis)? </li>
    <li>Does the volume of the DWI or PWI abnormality predict initial clinical severity, final infarct size, and late clinical outcome? </li>
</ol>
<p>The panel performed a literature search through January 2008 in the following databases: Medline (starting 1966), EMBASE (starting 1974), Biosis (starting 1969), and Sci (starting 1990). The exact keyword search is available in appendix e-1 of the Data Supplement document (see &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p>The panel identified 492 abstracts for question 1 (DWI), 213 for question 1 (PWI), and 210 for question 2. Two panel members reviewed each abstract. Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) unrelated to acute ischemic stroke &amp;lt;12 hours (question 1) or &amp;lt;24 hours (question 2) after symptom onset or unrelated to questions; 2) unrelated to DWI or PWI (i.e., computed tomography [CT], T2-weighted imaging, Xe-CT, positron emission tomography [PET], single photon emission computed tomography [SPECT]); 3) case report or case series with n &amp;lt;15; 4) review article; 5) letter to the editor or editorial; 6) involving pediatric patients or nonhuman subjects; or 7) nonclinical (e.g., technique development). The eligible publications of each pair were discussed with the whole panel to produce a final list of articles for each question.</p>
<p>The panel chose a time window of 12 hours for question 1 because most treatment studies for acute stroke have an inclusion window of &amp;lt;12 hours. DWI and PWI have a high diagnostic accuracy within the first hours, and effective treatment of acute stroke is negatively correlated with time from symptom onset.</p>
<p>Studies that included patients in a time window exceeding 12 hours were considered for inclusion if a subset of patients &amp;lt;12 hours was reported or the numbers for such a subset could be extracted. For question 2, the panel chose a time window of 24 hours and a sample size of 30 or more for inclusion. Furthermore, they excluded studies in which any patients received thrombolytic therapy so as not to confound the prognostic value of DWI and PWI with regard to the natural disease course.</p>
<p>Recently reported large open series, phase II and III randomized, placebo-controlled trials of MRI-guided IV thrombolysis in acute stroke (DIAS, DEDAS, DIAS-2, EPITHET) are a case in point. These trials selected patients for inclusion up to 9 hours from stroke onset on the basis of a qualitative MRI penumbral pattern. For this assessment, only the placebo groups of these trials would be eligible and helpful in judging diagnostic accuracy (question 1) or predictive value for baseline clinical status and clinical or structural outcome (question 2). No separate imaging data are available for any of these studies yet; in EPITHET, only summary data and the subgroups with PWI/DWI mismatch are presented.</p>

<p>A Guideline Development, Dissemination, and Implementation (GDDI) member who had expertise in stroke conducted a targeted literature search for high quality studies using the same criteria as presented in the original guideline. The GDDI reviewer and the subcommittee reviewed the new evidence and determined that the following three criteria were met: 1. There is no new evidence that would alter conclusions or recommendations in the guideline since the last literature search, 2. Guideline methodology is sound and current methodology is not substantially different, and 3. No significant practice variation relevant to the guideline currently exists</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Classification of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The strength of practice recommendations is linked directly to the level of evidence:</p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.)*</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an &quot;A&quot; recommendation if 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &amp;gt;5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &amp;gt; 2).</p></div>"/>
