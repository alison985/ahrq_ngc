	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

These recommendations may be applicable to sterile processing areas. Laundering of textiles is outside the scope of these recommendations. Environmental cleaning includes considerations for a safe environment of care, prevention of transmissible infections, and hand hygiene. These topics are addressed in separate recommended practices documents, and although they are mentioned briefly where applicable (e.g., standard precautions), broader discussions are outside the scope of this document.</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: upper-roman;&quot;>
    <li>A multidisciplinary team should establish cleaning procedures and frequencies in the perioperative practice setting. </li>
    <li>The patient should be provided with a clean, safe environment. </li>
    <li>A clean environment should be reestablished after the patient is transferred from the area (Sehulster et al., 2003; &quot;Practice guidance for healthcare environmental cleaning,&quot; 2012; 42 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 416, 2011; 42 CFR 482, 2011). </li>
    <li>Perioperative areas should be terminally cleaned. </li>
    <li>All areas and equipment that are not terminally cleaned should be cleaned according to an established schedule. </li>
    <li>All personnel should take precautionary measures to limit transmission of microorganisms when performing environmental cleaning and handling waste materials. </li>
    <li>Procedures for environmental cleaning and disinfection should be established for circumstances that may require special cleaning procedures (i.e., multidrug-resistant organisms, <em>Clostridium difficile</em>, prion diseases, construction, environmental contamination). </li>
    <li>Perioperative and environmental services personnel should receive initial and ongoing education and competency verification on their understanding of the principles and the performance of the processes for environmental cleaning in perioperative areas (Kak, Burkhalter &amp;amp; Cooper, 2001). </li>
    <li>Policies and procedures for environmental cleaning processes and practices should be developed, reviewed periodically, revised as necessary, and readily available in the practice setting. </li>
    <li>Perioperative personnel should participate in a variety of quality assurance and performance improvement activities that are consistent with the health care organization's plan to improve understanding of and compliance with the principles and processes of environmental cleaning. </li>

<p>A medical librarian conducted systematic searches of the databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized controlled and nonrandomized trials and studies, opinion documents, case reports, letters, reviews, and guidelines. Scopus was also consulted, although not searched systematically.</p>
<p>Search terms included: operating room, operating theater, operating suite, surgical suite, recovery room, post-anesthesia, post-anaesthesia, perioperative nursing, ambulatory care facilities, surgicenters, ambulatory surgery, outpatient surgery, healthcare facilities, terminal cleaning, terminal disinfecting, terminal decontamination, cleaning schedule, cleaning program, cleaning regimen, prior patient, prior room occupant, previous patient, cleaning standard, cleaning policies, cleaning guideline, cleaning protocol, routine cleaning, hospital housekeeping, housekeeping department, environmental services, cross infection, infection control, decontamination, room decontamination, disinfection, disinfectants, adenosine triphosphate, detergents, solvents, phenols, disinfectants, hydrogen peroxide, ultraviolet rays, fluorescent light, quaternary ammonium disinfectant, sodium hypochlorite, ozone, silver, copper, gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive bacteria, viruses, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, methicillin resistance, vancomycin, multi-drug resistant organism, clostridium, chickenpox, measles, varicella, rubeola, tuberculosis, prion diseases, prions, Creutzfeldt-Jakob, disease reservoir, dust, surgical wound infection, blood, body fluids, tissues, blood spill, semen, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, vaginal secretions, pericardial fluid, peritoneal fluid, saliva, amniotic fluid, air microbiology, air pollution, bacterial load, microbial colony count, environmental microbiology, environmental cleaning, green cleaning, mop, mopping, bucket, wringer, brush, buffers, floor machine, sweepers, microfiber, microfibre, paper towel, cloths, wiping, vacuum, environmental surface, contact surface, fomites, floors and floor coverings, interior design and furnishings, mites, lice, fleas, cockroaches, vermin, flies, ants, insects, pest control, textiles, bedding and linens, beds and mattresses, curtains, laundry, laundry service, cellular phone, cellphones, cell phones, telephones, wireless communications, mobile devices, iPad, tablets, laptops, computer systems, computers, keyboards, mouse, tables, beds, operating tables, mattress, stretcher, examination tables, patient transfer board, trolleys, carts, scrub sink, durable medical equipment, disposable equipment, equipment reuse, storage areas, hospitals, eye wash, operating room waste, clinical waste, medical waste, medical waste disposal, biohazardous waste, hazardous materials, formaldehyde, formalin, methyl methacrylate, storage, disposal, transport, handling, safety management, occupational health, occupational-related injuries, occupational exposure, contact precautions, standard precautions, droplet precautions, universal precautions, eye protective devices, masks, respiratory protective devices, protective clothing, gloves, goggles, gowns, environmental monitoring, luminescent measurements, checklists, visual inspection, fluorescent light, audit, tacky mat, sticky mat, hospital design and construction, demolition, construction materials, aspergillus, aspergillosis, central service department, sterile processing, sterile supply, central supply, central processing, task performance and analysis, job performance, competency-based education, continuing education, and human factors.</p>
<p>The search was originally limited to literature published in English between 2008 and 2013. The lead author and the medical librarian identified relevant guidelines from government agencies and standards-setting bodies, and the lead author requested additional articles that either did not fit the original search criteria or were discovered during the evidence appraisal process. The medical librarian also established continuing alerts on the environmental cleaning topics and provided relevant results to the lead author.</p></div>"/>
