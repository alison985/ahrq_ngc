	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The quality of evidence supporting the recommendations (<strong>I-III</strong>) and the strength of recommendations (<strong>A-C</strong>) are defined at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p>The original guideline document provides comprehensive information for the use of daily oral antiretroviral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of acquiring human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in adults. The key messages of the guideline are as follows:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Daily oral PrEP with the fixed-dose combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) 300 mg and emtricitabine (FTC) 200 mg has been shown to be safe and effective in reducing the risk of sexual HIV acquisition in adults; therefore,
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>PrEP is recommended as one prevention option for sexually-active adult MSM (men who have sex with men) at substantial risk of HIV acquisition. (<strong>IA</strong>) </li>
        <li>PrEP is recommended as one prevention option for adult heterosexually active men and women who are at substantial risk of HIV acquisition. (<strong>IA</strong>) </li>
        <li>PrEP is recommended as one prevention option for adult injection drug users (IDU) at substantial risk of HIV acquisition. (<strong>IA</strong>) </li>
        <li>PrEP should be discussed with heterosexually-active women and men whose partners are known to have HIV infection (i.e., HIV-discordant couples) as one of several options to protect the uninfected partner during conception and pregnancy so that an informed decision can be made in awareness of what is known and unknown about benefits and risks of PrEP for mother and fetus. (<strong>IIB</strong>) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Currently the data on the efficacy and safety of PrEP for adolescents are insufficient. Therefore, the risks and benefits of PrEP for adolescents should be weighed carefully in the context of local laws and regulations about autonomy in health care decision-making by minors. (<strong>IIIB</strong>) </li>
    <li>Acute and chronic HIV infection must be excluded by symptom history and HIV testing immediately before PrEP is prescribed. (<strong>IA</strong>) </li>
    <li>The only medication regimen approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recommended for PrEP with all the populations specified in this guideline is daily TDF 300 mg co-formulated with FTC 200 mg (Truvada). (<strong>IA</strong>)
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>TDF alone has shown substantial efficacy and safety in trials with IDUs and heterosexually active adults and can be considered as an alternative regimen for these populations, but not for MSM, among whom its efficacy has not been studied. (<strong>IC</strong>) </li>
        <li>The use of other antiretroviral medications for PrEP, either in place of or in addition to TDF/FTC (or TDF) is not recommended. (<strong>IIIA</strong>) </li>
        <li>The prescription of oral PrEP for coitally-timed or other noncontinuous daily use is not recommended. (<strong>IIIA</strong>) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>HIV infection should be assessed at least every 3 months while patients are taking PrEP so that those with incident infection do not continue taking it. The 2-drug regimen of TDF/FTC is inadequate therapy for established HIV infection, and its use may engender resistance to either or both drugs. (<strong>IA</strong>) </li>
    <li>Renal function should be assessed at baseline and monitored at least every 6 months while patients are taking PrEP so that those in whom renal failure is developing do not continue to take it. (<strong>IIIA</strong>) </li>
    <li>When PrEP is prescribed, clinicians should provide access, directly or by facilitated referral, to proven effective risk-reduction services. Because high medication adherence is critical to PrEP efficacy but was not uniformly achieved by trial participants, patients should be encouraged and enabled to use PrEP in combination with other effective prevention methods. (<strong>IIIA</strong>) </li>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>In 2009, in recognition of the lead time needed to develop clinical guidance for the safe and effective use of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) should clinical trials results support it, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initiated a formal guidelines development process to allow for early review of the relevant literature, discussion of potential guidelines content given scenarios of potential trial results, and fostering the development of expert and stakeholder consensus. This process was designed to provide a basis for the rapid issuance of interim guidance, to be followed by Public Health Service guidelines as soon as the earliest trial findings indicated sufficient PrEP efficacy and safety to merit its implementation for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention through one or more routes of transmission.</p>
<p>This guidelines development process was based on a review of experience with the development of other clinical and nonclinical guidelines at the CDC, including those for sexually transmitted disease (STD) treatment and antiretroviral prevention of mother-to-child transmission following the ACTG 076 trial results.</p>
<p>There were five basic components to the process for developing PrEP guidelines:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Public Health Service (PHS) Working Group to develop interagency consensus on major points of implementation policy and provide agency review of guidelines. This working group included representatives from agencies that would formally clear PHS guidelines (U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA], Health Resources and Services Administration [HRSA], National Institutes of Health [NIH], HHS/Office of HIV/AIDS Policy [OHAP]) as well as agencies that may implement such guidance (Indian Health Service [IHS], Veterans Administration [VA]). </li>
    <li>A CDC writing team responsible for preparing draft guidance documents based on the recommendations of the other groups involved in the guidelines process </li>
    <li>A number of external work groups responsible for considering specific sets of issues for the planned guidance. Each work group was composed of 5 to 8 members representative of the following:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Members of the academic community and scientists with expertise in the content area to ensure that the guideline elements are science-based </li>
        <li>Health department and clinical users of the guidelines to ensure the feasibility of implementing guideline elements in local and state HIV prevention programs </li>
        <li>At least one advocate or community-based organization member with personal or professional experience in the content area to serve as an ongoing bridge to community discussions and to supplement the advocate input received by other activities. </li>
        <li>Geographic diversity (multiple U.S. regions and small/medium/large jurisdictions) </li>
        <li>Experience with PrEP issues when possible </li>
    </ul>
    <p>External work groups were convened to consider the following areas:</p>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Clinical care guidance </li>
        <li>Clinic-based counseling guidance </li>
        <li>Integrating PrEP with other prevention services </li>
        <li>Persons potentially exposed by injection drug use </li>
        <li>Men who have sex with men (MSM) </li>
        <li>Women </li>
        <li>African American, Hispanic/Latino, and other heterosexual men </li>
        <li>Adolescents </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition to these standing work groups, technical expert panels were convened to inform guidelines for PrEP use in the following areas:</p>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Public health and clinical ethics </li>
        <li>Monitoring and evaluation framework </li>
        <li>Financing and reimbursement issues </li>
        <li>Preconception and intrapartum use of PrEP </li>
        <li>Public health legal and regulatory issues </li>
        <li>Issues relevant to benefits managers and insurers </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>A series of stakeholder web/phone conferences were held to receive input on questions, concerns, and preferences from a variety of perspectives including those of community-based organizations, state and local acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) offices, professional associations, and others. </li>
    <li>After the publication of the first efficacy trial results, a face-to-face consultation of external experts, partners, agencies, and other stakeholders was held to consider the recommendations for guidance made by the above groups and to discuss any additional ideas for inclusion in PrEP guidelines. </li>
</ol>
<p>This process allowed wide input, transparency in discussing the many issues involved, time for the evolution of awareness of PrEP and ideas for its possible implementation, in addition to facilitating the development of a consensus base for the eventual guidance. At the same time, it allowed for guidelines based on expert opinion, and recommendations deemed feasible by clinical providers and policymakers.</p>
<p>On the basis of results from the first 4 activities listed above and the publication in late November 2010 of results from the first clinical trial to show substantial efficacy and safety, the CDC issued interim guidance for PrEP use among men who have sex with men in January 2011. This interim guidance was followed by a face-to-face meeting of external in May 2011. As efficacy and safety results were published, additional interim guidance documents were issued for heterosexually active adults (August 2012) and injection drug users (July 2013). </p>
<p>A draft guidelines document incorporated recommendations from participants in the development process and information gleaned from literature reviews, including PrEP clinical trial results. The draft also addressed guidelines standards for review of the strength of evidence (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation [GRADE] approach) as well as a format designed to promote guideline implementation (Guideline Implementability Appraisal [GLIA]), dissemination (Global Evaluation and Monitoring [GEM]), and adoption (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation [AGREE]).</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>All patients whose sexual or drug injection history indicates consideration of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and who are interested in taking PrEP must undergo laboratory testing to identify those for whom this intervention would be harmful or for whom it would present specific health risks that would require close monitoring. </li>
    <li>In multivariable analyses, back pain was the only adverse event associated with receipt of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). </li>
    <li>In one study of daily oral TDF/emtricitabine (FTC) or TDF modest increases in gastrointestinal symptoms and fatigue were reported in the antiretroviral medication groups compared with the placebo group, primarily in the first month of use. </li>
    <li>In another study of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention efficacy and clinical safety of daily TDF/FTC among heterosexual women in South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania, only nausea and vomiting (in the first month) and transient, modest elevations in liver function test values were the adverse events more common among those assigned to TDF/FTC than those assigned to placebo. In another study the rates of nausea and vomiting were higher among TDF than among placebo recipients in the first 2 months of medication but not thereafter. </li>
    <li>Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed in HIV-infected persons treated with combination antiretroviral therapy (including TDF-containing regimes). Any person being considered for PrEP who has a history of pathologic or fragility bone fractures or who has significant risk factors for osteoporosis should be referred for appropriate consultation and management. </li>
    <li>PrEP use periconception and during pregnancy by the uninfected partner may offer an additional tool to reduce the risk of sexual HIV acquisition. Both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling information and the perinatal antiretroviral treatment guidelines permit this use. However, data directly related to the safety of PrEP use for a developing fetus are limited. Providers should discuss available information about potential risks and benefits of beginning or continuing PrEP during pregnancy so that an informed decision can be made. </li>
    <li>The safety of PrEP with TDF/FTC or TDF alone for infants exposed during lactation has not been adequately studied. However, data from studies of infants born to HIV-infected mothers and exposed to TDF or FTC through breast milk suggest limited drug exposure. Additionally, the World Health Organization has recommended the use of TDF/FTC or 3TC/efavirenz for all pregnant and breastfeeding women for the prevention of perinatal and postpartum mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Therefore, providers should discuss current evidence about the potential risks and benefits of beginning or continuing PrEP during breastfeeding so that an informed decision can be made. </li>
    <li>TDF presents a very high barrier to the development of hepatitis B virus (HBV) resistance. However, it is important to reinforce the need for consistent adherence to the daily doses of TDF/FTC to prevent reactivation of HBV infection with the attendant risk of hepatic injury, and to minimize the possible risk of developing TDF-resistant HBV infection. </li>
