      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The recommendation grades (<strong>A to C</strong>, <strong>Good Practice Point</strong>) are defined at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Who Is Eligible to Use Progestogen-only Implants?</span></strong></p>
<p>Health professionals should be familiar with the most up to date UK Medical Eligibility Criteria for the progestogen-only implant. <strong>(Good Practice Point)</strong></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Timing of Repeat Insertions</strong></span></p>
<p>If an implant is replaced immediately, and after no longer than 3 years since insertion, there is no need for additional contraceptive precautions after replacement. <strong>(Grade C)</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>What Are the Benefits and Risks of Progestogen-only Implant Use?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Non-contraceptive Benefits</strong></p>
<p>The progestogen-only implant may help to alleviate dysmenorrhoea. <strong>(Grade C)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Health Concerns</strong></p>
<p><em>Cardiovascular Health</em></p>
<p>There is little or no increased risk of venous thromboembolism, stroke or myocardial infarction associated with the use of the progestogen-only implant. <strong>(Grade C)</strong></p>
<p><em>Bone Mineral Density</em></p>
<p>There is no evidence of a clinically significant adverse effect on bone mineral density with use of a progestogen-only implant. <strong>(Grade B)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Side Effects</strong></p>
<p><em>Changes to Bleeding Patterns</em></p>
<p>Fewer than one-quarter of women using the progestogen-only implant will have regular bleeds. Infrequent bleeding is the most common pattern (approximately one-third); around one-fifth of women experience no bleeding; and approximately one-quarter have prolonged or frequent bleeding. Altered bleeding patterns are likely to remain irregular. <strong>(Grade C)</strong></p>
<p><em>Changes in Weight, Mood, Libido</em></p>
<p>Although some women do report changes in weight, mood and libido when using the progestogen-only implant, there is no evidence of a causal association. <strong>(Grade C)</strong></p>
<p><em>Acne</em></p>
<p>Women may experience improvement, worsening or new onset of acne during use of a progestogen-only implant. <strong>(Grade C)</strong></p>
<p><em>Headache</em></p>
<p>Although some women report headache with use of the progestogen-only implant, there is no evidence of a causal association. <strong>(Grade C)</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>How Should the Progestogen-only Implant Be Inserted, Removed and Replaced?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Training Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Health professionals who insert and/or remove progestogen-only implants should be appropriately trained, maintain competence and attend regular updates. <strong>(Grade C)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anaesthesia</strong></p>
<p>Appropriate local anaesthesia should be administered prior to insertion and removal of a progestogen-only implant. <strong>(Good Practice Point)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Removal</strong></p>
<p>There is no need for additional precautions or abstinence prior to removal of a progestogen-only implant, providing the removal occurs no later than 3 years after insertion. <strong>(Grade C)</strong></p>
<p>After removal of a progestogen-only implant, effective contraception is required immediately if pregnancy is not desired. <strong>(Grade B)</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>What Information Should Be Given to Implant Users about Continuation and Follow-up?</span></strong></p>
<p>Women using progestogen-only implants should be advised that no routine follow-up is required, but that they can return at any time to discuss problems or change their contraceptive method. <strong>(Good Practice Point)</strong></p>
<p>Women using a progestogen-only implant should be advised to return if: they cannot feel their implant or if it appears to have changed shape; they notice any skin changes or pain around the site of the implant; they become pregnant; or they develop any condition that may contraindicate continuation of the method. <strong>(Good Practice Point)</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>What Factors Might Reduce the Efficacy of the Progestogen-only Implant?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Drug Interactions</strong></p>
<p>Concomitant use of enzyme-inducing drugs may reduce the efficacy of the progestogen-only implant. Women should be advised to switch to a method unaffected by enzyme-inducing drugs or to use additional contraception until 28 days after stopping the treatment. <strong>(Grade C)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Weight</strong></p>
<p>Obesity (body mass index [BMI] &amp;gt;30kg/m<sup>2</sup>) is a condition for which there is no restriction on the use of the progestogen-only implant (UK Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use 1). <strong>(Grade C)</strong></p>
<p>No increased risk of pregnancy has been demonstrated in women weighing up to 149 kg. However, because of the inverse relationship between weight and serum etonogestrel levels, a reduction in the duration of contraceptive efficacy cannot be completely excluded. <strong>(Grade C)</strong></p>
<p>Women using the progestogen-only implant should be informed, where relevant, that the manufacturer states that earlier replacement can be considered in 'heavier' women but that there is no direct evidence to support earlier replacement. <strong>(Good Practice Point)</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>What Other Issues Should Women Be Advised to Consider?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sexually Transmitted Infections and Testing</strong></p>
<p>The consistent and correct use of condoms is the most efficient means of protecting against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections. <strong>(Grade B)</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Managing Problems Associated with Progestogen-only Implant Use</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Impalpable Implant</strong></p>
<p>A woman with an impalpable implant should be advised to use additional precautions or avoid intercourse until the presence of an implant is confirmed. <strong>(Good Practice Point)</strong></p>
<p>The location of an impalpable or deep implant should be identified before exploratory surgery. Referral to an expert implant removal centre is recommended. The location of an impalpable or deep implant should be identified before exploratory surgery. Referral to an expert implant removal centre is recommended. <strong>(Good Practice Point)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Problematic Bleeding</strong></p>
<p>After exclusion of other causes, women who experience troublesome bleeding while using the progestogen-only implant, and who are eligible to use combined hormonal contraception, may be offered combined oral contraception (COC) cyclically or continuously for 3 months (outside product licence). Longer-term use of the implant and COC has not been studied and is a matter of clinical judgement. <strong>(Good Practice Point)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p>The progestogen-only implant is not known to be harmful in pregnancy but women with a continuing pregnancy should be advised to have the implant removed. Women may retain the implant if they wish to continue the method after a non-continuing pregnancy. <strong>(Grade C)</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Grades of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Evidence based on randomised controlled trials</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: Evidence based on other robust experimental or observational studies</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: Evidence is limited but the advice relies on expert opinion and has the endorsement of respected authorities</p>
<p><strong>Good Practice Point</strong>: Where no evidence exists but where best practice is based on the clinical experience of the guideline group</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Clinical Effectiveness Unit (CEU) Guidance is developed in collaboration with the Clinical Effectiveness Committee (CEC) of the Faculty of Sexual &amp;amp; Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH). The CEU Guidance development process employs standard methodology and makes use of systematic literature review and a multidisciplinary group of professionals. The multidisciplinary group is identified by the CEU for their expertise in the topic area and typically includes clinicians working in family planning, sexual and reproductive health care, general practice, other allied specialties, and user representation. In addition, the aim is to include a representative from the FSRH CEC, the FSRH Meetings Committee and FSRH Council in the multidisciplinary group.</p>
<p>Recommendations are based primarily on evidence directly relating to both forms of the etonogestrel implant (referred to as the progestogen-only implant) and consensus opinion of experts. Where there is limited evidence, extrapolation of data from other progestogen-only implants (Norplant<sup>&amp;reg;</sup> and Jadelle<sup>&amp;reg;</sup>) has been used. As Nexplanon and Implanon are bioequivalent, recommendations other than those relating to insertion and localisation apply equally to both products.</p>
<p><strong>Drafting the Document</strong></p>
<p>Guidelines are initially drafted by the CEU Researcher and Director. The CEU researcher has responsibility for undertaking the literature search, appraising documents, preparing evidence tables and writing the initial draft of the document. This is then sent to the CEU Director who reviews and amends the document accordingly. Drafts are subsequently reviewed by a selected Multidisciplinary Group (MDG), the FSRH CEC, and independent peer reviewers before a draft is prepared for public consultation. It is the responsibility of the CEU researcher and Director to review any feedback submitted by the MDG, CEC, independent peer reviewers and wider public and amend the document accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Formulating Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Each recommendation is formulated so that it is specific for a defined patient group in defined situations. The patient group(s) and situation(s) are consistent with the specified scope of the guidance. Search strategies are implemented looking at the population in question, the intervention, e.g., contraceptive and outcome of interest, e.g., safety, bone health, weight gain. Where relevant the corresponding UK Medical Eligibility Criteria (UKMEC) category is stated.</p>
<p>Following critical appraisal of the available evidence, recommendations are initially drafted by the CEU. Each recommendation is graded and the grading presented clearly next to the recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The first draft of the document is circulated to members of the MDG for comment. Members may provide feedback on the body of text and also the recommendations. </li>
    <li>Recommendations may be redrafted in light of feedback from the MDG. </li>
    <li>The CEU will continue to receive feedback on the text and recommendations with future drafts. </li>
    <li>From May 2011 at the penultimate draft stage prior to issuing guidance for public consultation individuals of the MDG will be asked to score recommendations using Likert scale 1-3 agree 7-9 disagree. </li>
    <li>Consensus will be reached when 80% of those responding score 1-3. </li>
    <li>Recommendations where consensus is not reached will be redrafted in light of any feedback. </li>
    <li>The consensus scoring sheets will be sent again for all recommendations. Consensus will be reached when 80% of those responding score 1-3. </li>
    <li>If consensus is not reached on certain recommendations, these will be redrafted once more. If after one more round of scoring consensus is still not reached, the recommendation will be taken to the CEC for final decision. Any group member who is not content with the decision can choose to have their disagreement noted within the guidance. </li>

Use of the progestogen-only implant is cost-effective at 1 year of use. The implant is more cost-effective than combined oral contraception or progestogen-only injectables. The intrauterine device is more cost-effective than the implant, but the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio decreases over time. The implant is more cost-effective than the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) with 3 years of use, after which the LNG-IUS becomes more cost-effective.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The implant is a highly effective contraceptive. The overall pregnancy rate reported in the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline on <em>Long-acting Reversible Contraception</em> is &amp;lt;1 in 1000 over 3 years. A review of contraceptive failure in the USA has estimated that the percentage of women in the USA experiencing an unintended pregnancy within the first year of using the progestogen-only implant is 0.05%. </li>
    <li>Dysmenorrhoea and ovulatory pain that are not associated with any identifiable pathological condition may be alleviated by hormonal methods that inhibit ovulation, and improvements have been noted with the progestogen-only implant. </li>
</ul>"/>
    </field>
    <field fieldid="153" ordby="710" id="429" name="Potential Harms" type="text">
      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Unscheduled bleeding in the first 3 months after starting a new hormonal contraceptive method is common. The progestogen-only implant is associated with unpredictable bleeding patterns; however, the bleeding pattern in the first 3 months is broadly predictive of future bleeding patterns for many women. Dissatisfaction with bleeding has been cited as a reason for implant discontinuation. Infrequent bleeding (&amp;lt;2 episodes of bleeding/spotting over a 90-day period according to the World Health Organization definition) is common, with around one-third of implant users in clinical trials experiencing this scenario. Amenorrhoea (no bleeding over a 90-day period) has been cited in around 21% of users; prolonged bleeding (&amp;ge;1 bleeding/spotting episode occurring on &amp;ge;10 days in a 90-day period) in around 17% of users; and around 6% of users have reported frequent bleeding (&amp;gt;4 episodes of bleeding/spotting in a 90-day period). </li>
    <li>There are reports of women experiencing weight gain and mood changes whilst using the progestogen-only implant. Decreased libido is listed within the summary of product characteristics (SPC) as a commonly (between 1 in 100 to 1 in 10) reported undesirable effect within clinical trials. Non-comparative studies have reported decreased libido in fewer than 6% of users of progestogen-only implants. </li>
    <li>Progestogen-only implant use may affect acne in some women. Acne has been shown to occur, improve or worsen with the use of a progestogen-only implant. </li>
    <li>Headache is very commonly reported in clinical trials of the progestogen-only implant and the SPC includes headache as a possibly related undesirable effect. However, headaches are a common symptom in the general population and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) indicates that a causal relationship cannot be confirmed. </li>
    <li>Skin atrophy is recognised as a potential adverse effect of steroid hormone use, and there are case reports in the literature of atrophy at the site of subdermal implants. </li>
    <li>Non-insertion of the implant, deep insertion and nerve injury are three types of harm cited in litigation cases involving the contraceptive implant. Vascular injury and rarely intravascular insertion have also been reported. Estimating the frequency with which such events happen is difficult as much of the evidence comes from postmarketing surveillance and case reports. </li>
    <li>Deep implant insertions are more likely a result of the insertion technique. If an implant is inserted too deeply it may be difficult to remove and/or locate, and there is greater potential for neurovascular injury, infection and scar formation. </li>
    <li>Incidents of nerve injury and neuropathy associated with the insertion or removal of Implanon are documented in the literature. </li>
    <li>Fibrosis around the implant and implant breakages have been documented as possible complications. Through the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare enquiry service anecdotal reports have been received of implants being sited too superficially, causing pain and altered sensation. </li>
    <li>An impalpable implant should not be assumed to be a deep implant. Any woman with an impalpable implant should be advised to use additional precautions or avoid intercourse until further investigation can be undertaken and the presence of an implant confirmed. The need for emergency contraception and a pregnancy test should be considered if there has been a potential risk. </li>
    <li>As with all procedures there is a risk of collapse due to a vasovagal reaction or anaphylaxis. </li>
