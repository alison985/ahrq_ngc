	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><em>Note from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</em></strong>: Table 1 in the original guideline document (see the &quot;Guideline Availability&quot; field) contains a comparison between the 2009 recommendations and the new recommendations, as well as the strength of recommendation and strength of evidence for each recommendation.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Question</span></strong></p>
<p>Which pharmacologic interventions reduce the risk of developing breast cancer in women not previously diagnosed with breast cancer?</p>
<p><strong>Selective Estrogen Receptor (ER) Modulators (SERMs)</strong></p>
<p><em>Tamoxifen Recommendation</em></p>
<p>Tamoxifen (20 mg per day orally for 5 years) should be discussed as an option to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer, specifically ER-positive breast cancer, in premenopausal and postmenopausal women who are age &amp;ge;35 years with a 5-year projected absolute breast cancer risk &amp;ge;1.66%, according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (or equivalent measures), or with lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). The risk reduction benefit continues for at least 10 years in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Tamoxifen is not recommended for use in women with a history of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or during prolonged immobilization. Tamoxifen is not recommended for women who are pregnant, women who may become pregnant, or nursing mothers. Tamoxifen is not recommended in combination with hormone therapy. Follow-up while on tamoxifen should include a timely workup of abnormal vaginal bleeding. Discussions with patients by health care providers should include both the risks and benefits of tamoxifen.</p>
<p><em>Raloxifene Recommendation</em></p>
<p>Raloxifene (60 mg per day orally for 5 years) should be discussed as an option to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer, specifically ER-positive breast cancer, in postmenopausal women who are age &amp;ge;35 years with a 5-year projected absolute breast cancer risk &amp;ge;1.66%, according to the NCI Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (or equivalent measures), or with LCIS. Raloxifene may be used longer than 5 years in women with osteoporosis, in whom breast cancer risk reduction is a secondary benefit. Raloxifene should not be used for breast cancer risk reduction in premenopausal women and is not recommended for use in women with a history of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or during prolonged immobilization. Discussions with patients by health care providers should include both the risks and benefits of raloxifene.</p>
<p><strong>Aromatase Inhibitors</strong></p>
<p><em>Exemestane Recommendation</em></p>
<p>Exemestane (25 mg per day orally for 5 years) should be discussed as an alternative to tamoxifen and/or raloxifene to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer, specifically ER-positive breast cancer, in postmenopausal women age &amp;ge;35 years with a 5-year projected breast cancer absolute risk &amp;ge;1.66%, according to the NCI Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (or equivalent measures), or with LCIS or atypical hyperplasia. Exemestane should not be used for breast cancer risk reduction in premenopausal women. Discussions with patients and health care providers should include both the risks and benefits of each agent under consideration.</p>
<p>Of note, exemestane is U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved only for the adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer and the treatment of advanced breast cancer, not for breast cancer risk reduction (<a href=&quot;http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2011/020753s009s011s012lbl.pdf&quot; title=&quot;FDA Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2011/020753s009s011s012lbl.pdf</a>).</p>
<p><em>Anastrozole Recommendation</em></p>
<p>The Update Committee concluded that there was insufficient evidence to provide a recommendation for anastrozole to guide clinical practice.</p></div>"/>

<p><strong>Literature Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The Update Committee completed a systematic review and analysis of the literature published since the 2009 guideline update. The Update Committee's literature review focused attention on available systematic reviews and meta-analyses of published phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on breast cancer risk reduction. Literature searches of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Collaboration Library were performed. Searches of the English language literature from June 2007 through June 2012 were conducted to address each of the guideline recommendations. The searches were supplemented with the references of the selected articles as well as references provided by guideline Update Committee members. A summary of the literature review results is provided in a Quality of Reporting of Meta-Analyses (QUOROM) diagram in the online Data Supplement Table DS7 (available at <a href=&quot;http://www.asco.org/guidelines/bcrr&quot; title=&quot;ASCO Web site&quot;>http://www.asco.org/guidelines/bcrr</a>; see also the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Searches were limited to phase III RCTs, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and existing clinical practice guidelines. Retrospective cohort studies were permitted if they were embedded within an RCT. Other study designs, including prospective or retrospective cohort studies and phase I or II trials, were excluded. English-language studies available in full text and published in peer-reviewed journals were eligible. Articles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review of the evidence if they met the following criteria: (1) the intervention consisted of one of the specified chemoprevention agents for the prevention of primary breast cancer; (2) participants were randomly assigned to a chemoprevention arm or a control arm (control arm could consist of no chemoprevention agent, a placebo, the same chemoprevention agent at an alternate dose/route, or a different chemoprevention agent); and (3) outcomes reported included at least one of the following: breast cancer incidence, breast cancer&amp;ndash;specific mortality, overall mortality, net health benefits, or quality of life. The primary outcome of interest was incidence of invasive and noninvasive breast cancer (including ductal carcinoma in situ). The guideline is limited to pharmacologic interventions, and therefore, evaluations of surgical and lifestyle interventions were excluded from consideration. The Update Committee Co-Chairs reviewed the title lists of included and excluded abstracts, and full text articles were obtained for each included abstract.</p></div>"/>

<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee convened an Update Committee of experts in clinical medicine, public health, clinical research, health services, and related areas (i.e., biostatistics, epidemiology, cancer prevention, patient-physician communication) with expertise in breast cancer prevention, along with a patient representative.</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Development Process</strong></p>
<p>The Update Committee held a teleconference in June 2012 to review the evidence and draft the guideline recommendations. Before the teleconference, the Update Committee members were sent evidence tables for review and were asked to complete an online survey about the content of the recommendations. During the teleconference, the Committee discussed the evidence and issues for each agent and the content of the recommendations. After the teleconference, a draft of the recommendations was sent to the entire Update Committee for comments. Any contentious comments or questions raised were addressed by e-mail until agreement was reached by the Committee. Additional work on the guideline document was completed through a steering group and by e-mail. All members of the Update Committee participated in the preparation of the draft guideline document and reviewed and approved the final guideline document.</p></div>"/>

<p>Serious adverse events associated with tamoxifen use include endometrial cancer, stroke, transient ischemic attack, venous thromboembolism, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. Two studies have also identified specific subgroups of women at increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism while on tamoxifen: women who are immobilized in the prior 3 months and/or women who have body mass index (BMI) &amp;gt;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Raloxifene</strong></p>
<p>Raloxifene is associated with a more favorable adverse effect profile compared with tamoxifen including a significantly lower risk of thromboembolic disease (statistically significant only for deep vein thrombosis) and uterine cancer and lower incidence of benign uterine hyperplasia, cataracts, and cataract surgery.</p>
<p><strong>Exemestane</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Table 6 in the original guideline document summarizes the key findings for adverse events in the MAP.3 trial. Overall, more adverse events occurred in the exemestane group compared with the placebo group of the MAP.3 trial. There were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of serious adverse events including cardiovascular events, skeletal fractures, other cancers, or treatment-related deaths. Statistically significant differences were observed for endocrine-related adverse events (i.e., hot flashes, fatigue, sweating, insomnia), constitutional and gastrointestinal (GI) events (i.e., diarrhea and nausea), and joint and muscle pain. </li>
    <li>Results from a post hoc nested substudy of the MAP.3 trial demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in bone mineral density and cortical thickness at the distal tibia and distal radius, lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck. Compared with placebo, 2 years of treatment with exemestane worsened age-related bone loss in postmenopausal women, despite calcium and vitamin D supplementation. </li>
    <li>Minimal differences in quality-of-life outcomes were observed between the exemestane and placebo groups. There was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of vasomotor symptoms, bodily pain, and sexual problems in women who took exemestane compared with women in the placebo group. </li>
