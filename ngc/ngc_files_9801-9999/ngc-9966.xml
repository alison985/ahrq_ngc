      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Eligibility Criteria</strong></p>
<p>To accomplish systematic literature reviews, a list of eligibility criteria was developed by the Ottawa Methods Group, who decided to follow the population, intervention, comparator, outcomes, period of time, and study design (PICOPS) strategy, in order to ensure inclusion of relevant studies. Therefore, the inclusion and exclusion criteria include the characteristics of the population, intervention, comparator, outcomes, the period of time an intervention becomes effective, and the study design (see Table 2 in the original guideline document). Only articles written in English or French, from 1966 until February 2011, were selected.</p>
<p><strong>Type of Participants</strong></p>
<p>Studies were chosen if the comparison groups were composed of participants aged over 40 years who were diagnosed with OA of the knee, as defined by Klippel et al. For the inclusion of participants, the studies were required to follow the Kellgren-Lawrence grading scale, according to the radiologic and/or clinical assessment of OA. The patients had to show no signs of psychiatric conditions, demonstrate stable physical and medical status, and have a healthy weight (body mass index [BMI] &amp;lt;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Mixed populations were permitted only if they consisted of patients with OA or rheumatoid arthritis, where the patients with OA were the majority. For the complete list of exclusion criteria and the PICOPS process please refer to Table 2 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Risk of Bias across Studies</strong></p>
<p>Studies that were described only in an abstract, where authors could not be contacted for further details, were automatically excluded because they did not provide enough results for the data analysis. Time and translation costs were limited, therefore only English and French studies were selected (see Table 2 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>Information Sources</strong></p>
<p>The library scientist (J.M.) performed a systematic search of the literature using a search strategy proposed by the Cochrane Collaboration. The main focus of the search was to identify the methodology and study design determined by primary studies, rather than identifying outcomes. In other words, the library scientist based her search on relevant topics, by including OA terms, physical therapy terms (e.g., walking), and study design terms. The systematic approach, which consisted of an organized method for the selection of articles, data extraction, and synthesis analyses decreased the possibility of presenting bias. See Appendix 2 in the original guideline document for more details on how the literature search was completed.</p>
<p>The search was conducted using the electronic databases EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, PEDro, SCOPUS, BioMed, SUMsearch, and Cochrane Library and also included case-control, cohort, and nonrandomized studies up until February 2011.</p>
<p><strong>Data Collection Process</strong></p>
<p><em>Study Selection/Data Items</em></p>
<p>After a systematic search of the literature, a pair of reviewers evaluated the studies. Referring to the inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Table 2 in the original guideline document), the reviewers created a list of the included and excluded articles. The reviewers referred to the principal assessor when uncertainty was present.</p></div>"/>

<p><strong>Data Extraction</strong></p>
<p>The reviewers independently extracted important information from each included study using standardized data extraction forms. This included the characteristics of participants, treatment, study design, allocation concealment, comparative results, and period of data collection.</p>
<p><strong>Methodologic Quality Assessment/Risk of Bias in Individual Studies</strong></p>
<p>The Jadad scale was used to assess the methodologic quality of each study selected. Each study was awarded a maximum of 5 points: 2 points for the randomization method, 2 points for double-blinding, and 1 point for a description of the dropouts. The reviewers referred to the principal assessor when differences were noticed in data extraction and Jadad scale scoring. A study assessed at a Jadad scale score of 3 or more points is typically considered as having high methodologic quality. The Ottawa Panel accepted the inclusion of studies with a Jadad scale score of less than 3 points. Points for double-blindness were rarely given because of the nature and difficulties of blinding therapists or participants during physical therapy treatments. Consequently, more importance was given to the 2 other categories of the Jadad scale, which are randomization and withdrawals (see Appendix 3 in the original guideline document). Articles were excluded if they did not meet the selected inclusion criteria according to the Ottawa Panel (see Table 2 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>Data Analysis/Summary Measures</strong></p>
<p>The Cochrane Collaboration methods were used to perform statistical analysis (<a href=&quot;http://www.cochrane.org&quot; title=&quot;Cochrane Collaboration Web site&quot;>www.cochrane.org</a>). Weighted mean differences between the experimental and control groups were calculated for continuous data, allowing for the calculation of the mean and standard deviation (SD) corresponding to the sample size of each group. According to the Cochrane Collaboration, for each specific outcome, weighted mean differences were indicated by a square and the SD of the weighted mean difference was illustrated by a horizontal line. As long as the horizontal line reached the central vertical axis, the weighted mean difference between the 2 comparative groups was not statistically different because the confidence interval included zero (see Figure 1A at 9 mo in the original guideline document). By subtracting the improvement of the experimental group with the improvement in the control group, it is possible to calculate the absolute benefit. The relative difference can be found by dividing the absolute benefit out of the baseline mean (weighted for the treatment and control groups). Selected by the Philadelphia Panel and adopted by the rheumatology and biostatistician experts of the Ottawa Panel, an improvement of 15% relative to a control group contributes to the achievement of clinical improvement. For dichotomous variables, the clinical improvement is calculated as the difference between the percent improved among the experimental and control groups. For more details about the statistical analysis, see the previous publications of the Ottawa Panel. According to the Cochrane Collaboration, the standardized mean difference is used as a summary statistic, which represents the recommended effect size when studies select the same outcome but are measured with a different scale in the meta-analysis. The goal of calculating this value is to standardize and combine the results of the studies to a uniform statistic for pooling and comparison purposes (see Figures 1B and 1C in the original guideline document). The individual results for each randomized controlled trial (RCT) are shown in Figures 1B and 1C in the original guideline document. The global effect of the pooled results of Figures 1B and C is indicated in the Results section of the original guideline document.</p></div>"/>
