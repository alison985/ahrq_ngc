    <field fieldid="151" ordby="310" id="421" name="Major Recommendations" type="text">
      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Recommendation 1</strong>: The Canadian Drug Expert Committee (CDEC) recommends that a sulfonylurea be added to metformin for most adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin alone.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons for Recommendation</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>All of the drug classes demonstrated similar improvements in glycated hemoglobin (A1C). Sulfonylureas were the most cost-effective treatment option, with an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of $8,445 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained compared with metformin alone. </li>
    <li>There are considerably more long-term safety data for sulfonylureas compared to drugs from the newer classes of antihyperglycemic agents. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Of Note</strong></p>
<p>Although there were 69 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included in the systematic review, the evidence was limited by the lack of adequate data for clinically important outcomes such as diabetes-related complications and severe hypoglycemia.</p>
<p>The Committee identified the values of safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness as being of particular importance in making this recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2</strong>: The CDEC recommends that insulin neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) be added for most adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin and a sulfonylurea.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons for Recommendation</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Based on the results of a network meta-analysis of 24 RCTs in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and inadequate glycemic control on metformin and a sulfonylurea, statistically significant reductions in hemoglobin A1C of similar magnitude were found for all classes of antihyperglycemic drugs added to existing therapy, with the exception of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors and meglitinides. The addition of insulin NPH to metformin plus a sulfonylurea was associated with the most favourable cost-effectiveness estimate. </li>
    <li>There are considerably more long-term safety data for the use of insulin NPH compared with drugs from the newer classes of antihyperglycemic agents. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Of Note</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>The evidence provided in the 40 RCTs that were included in the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) systematic review was limited by the lack of data for clinically important outcomes such as diabetes-related complications and severe hypoglycemia. </li>
    <li>Long-acting insulin analogues at prices similar to insulin NPH would also be an option for patients inadequately controlled on metformin and a sulfonylurea. </li>
    <li>Although there is more clinical experience with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues since the original CADTH recommendations were published, the Committee concluded that there remains uncertainty regarding the long-term safety of these drug classes. The Committee noted that additional long-term follow-up data &amp;mdash; including the results of ongoing trials designed to investigate the effects of DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 analogues on cardiovascular end points ― may help address this uncertainty in the future. </li>
</ol>
<p>The Committee identified the values of safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness as being of particular importance in making this recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 3</strong>: In circumstances where patients are unable to use insulin as a third-line option, the CDEC recommends that a DPP-4 inhibitor may be added to metformin and sulfonylurea therapy.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>DPP-4 inhibitors were the most cost-effective option when insulins were excluded from the cost-effectiveness analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Of Note</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>The Committee noted that there are few instances where patients with type 2 diabetes are unable to use insulin after adequate education and training. However, the Committee recognized that an alternative to insulin should be available to facilitate optimal glycemic control for such patients. </li>
    <li>The Committee noted that although DPP-4 inhibitors were the most cost-effective option when insulin is not an option, the addition of agents from this drug class to metformin and a sulfonylurea was associated with a relatively high incremental cost per QALY gained relative to metformin and a sulfonylurea alone ($113,254). </li>
</ol>
<p>The Committee identified the values of efficacy and cost-effectiveness as of particular importance in making this recommendation.</p></div>"/>

<p><strong>Literature Review</strong></p>
<p>Published literature was identified by searching the following bibliographic databases: MEDLINE with In-Process records and daily updates via Ovid; EMBASE via Ovid; The Cochrane Library via Ovid; and PubMed.</p>
<p>Grey literature (literature that is not commercially published) was identified by searching keys sections of the Grey Matters checklist (<a href=&quot;http://www.cadth.ca/en/resources/finding-evidence-is/grey-matters/grey-matters-light&quot; title=&quot;CADTH Web site&quot;>http://www.cadth.ca/en/resources/finding-evidence-is/grey-matters</a>), which includes the websites of regulatory agencies, health technology assessment agencies, and professional associations. Google and other Internet search engines were used to search for additional web-based materials. These searches were supplemented by reviewing the bibliographies of key papers, and through contacts with appropriate experts and industry.</p>
<p>For second-line therapy and third line therapy, the search identified documents published between January 1, 2009 and May 7, 2012. Regular alerts were established to update these searches until the publication of the final reports.</p>
<p>Full literature search strategies, including specific search terms used, can be found in the second-line therapy and third-line therapy reports (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Methodological filters were applied to limit retrieval to health technology assessments, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and economic studies. Where possible, retrieval was limited to the human population. The search was also limited to English language documents published between January 1, 2009, and May 7, 2012 for second- and third-line therapy. Conference abstracts were excluded from the search results.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Second- and Third-Line Pharmacotherapies</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Outcomes of Interest</strong></p>
<p>Compared with the original CADTH analysis, this update focused on outcomes that were primary considerations of CADTH's Therapeutic Review Panel in developing the original recommendations. These include mortality, diabetes-related complications, glycated hemoglobin (A1C), bodyweight, hypoglycemia, and serious adverse events (SAEs). Evidence for diabetes-related complications was only reviewed from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that were designed and powered to compare the effect of two or more treatments on such end points.</p>
<p><strong>Data Extraction and Critical Appraisal</strong></p>
<p>Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed by one reviewer, and verified by a second reviewer. Disagreements at any of these stages were resolved through consensus or by a third reviewer if consensus could not be reached. Risk of bias for the included RCTs was assessed using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network questionnaire (SIGN-50).</p>
<p><strong>Statistical Analysis</strong></p>
<p>The original network meta-analyses (NMAs) for second- and third-line therapy were updated with data from the newly identified trials. The methodology employed was the same as that used in the original CADTH analysis. WinBUGS (MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge, UK) was used for the network meta-analyses according to the routine developed at the Universities of Bristol and Leicester. Metformin monotherapy was the reference group for all network meta-analyses analyses. Posterior densities for unknown parameters were estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Basic parameters were assigned non-informative or vague prior distributions. Point estimates and 95% credible intervals (CrIs) were used to summarize all findings. The probability of a drug class being optimal was estimated for each outcome based on the proportion of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations in which its relative measure of effect was best. We also calculated the mean rank for each drug class. Model diagnostics including trace plots and the Brooks-Gelman-Rubin statistic were assessed to ensure model convergence. Two chains were fit into WinBUGS for each analysis, each employing &amp;ge;20,000 iterations, with a burn-in of &amp;ge;20,000 iterations.</p>
<p>Frequentist pairwise meta-analysis was performed using R &amp;mdash; a language and software environment for statistical computing. A random effects model was used for the reference case in all pairwise and NMAs. The robustness of the reference case for A1C was assessed using alternative modelling, sensitivity analyses, and meta-regressions.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Pharmacoeconomic Review Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The following research questions were addressed in the updated pharmacoeconomic review of second- and third-line diabetes pharmacotherapy:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>What is the cost-effectiveness of second-line antidiabetes drugs in adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy? </li>
    <li>What is the cost-effectiveness of third-line antidiabetes drugs in adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin and a sulfonylurea? </li>
</ol>
<p>The cost-utility analysis was conducted using a new version of the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Outcomes Model previously used in the original CADTH reviews. The newer UKPDS Outcomes Model was updated to reflect the most current clinical evidence, drug prices, and management costs. The key feature of this update was the incorporation of GLP-1 analogues.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Second-Line Pharmacotherapy</strong></p>
<p>The Committee considered the results of a class-level cost-effectiveness analysis that compared alternative second-line therapies in adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy. The analysis compared nine treatment classes added to metformin as second-line therapy (alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, thiazolidinediones [TZDs], basal insulin, biphasic insulin, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 [DPP-4] inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] analogues, and placebo). The lowest cost alternative for each class of drugs was used in the primary economic analysis. The average daily costs of treatments were estimated with and without the additional cost of blood glucose test strips (see Table 2 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>Average test strip use, by type of pharmacotherapy, was obtained from an analysis of the Ontario Public Drug Programs. A cost of $0.729 per test strip plus a pharmacy fee of $7.00 per 100 test strips was applied. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model was used to forecast the cumulative incidence of diabetes-related complications during a 40-year time horizon, as well as associated costs. For each treatment strategy, inputs for predictive risk factors in the model &amp;mdash; such as hemoglobin A1C, body mass index, and body weight &amp;mdash; were informed by the results of the systematic review and network meta-analysis. Overall hypoglycemia, severe hypoglycemia, and congestive heart failure (regarding TZDs) were also considered in the model.</p>
<p>In the reference-case analysis, the addition of a sulfonylurea to metformin monotherapy was associated with the most favourable cost-effectiveness estimate compared with metformin monotherapy, with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of $8,445 relative to metformin alone (see Table 3 in the original guideline document). Other active treatments were more costly and associated with a range of QALYs gained compared with sulfonylureas, although absolute differences in QALYs across classes were small. Cost-effectiveness results were robust to variation in model inputs and assumptions. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that sulfonylureas had the highest probability of being the most cost-effective second-line treatment option for willingness-to-pay thresholds above ~$22,000 per QALY gained.</p>
<p>A limitation of the economic analysis was the lack of adequate clinical data to inform key model inputs, especially the impact of insulin use and hypoglycemia on quality of life, and the incidence of hypoglycemia across various treatments.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Line Pharmacotherapy</strong></p>
<p>The Committee considered the results of a class-level cost-effectiveness analysis that compared alternative third-line therapies in adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin and a sulfonylurea. The analysis compared five classes added to metformin and a sulfonylurea as third-line therapy (basal insulin, biphasic insulin, DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 analogues, and placebo). The lowest cost alternative for each class of drugs was used in the primary economic analysis. TZDs were not included in the reference-case analysis, as they are not indicated for third-line treatment of type 2 diabetes in Canada, but they were included in a sensitivity analysis. The average daily costs of treatments were estimated with and without the additional cost of blood glucose test strips (see Table 4 in the original guideline document). Average test strip use, by type of pharmacotherapy, was obtained from an analysis of the Ontario Public Drug Programs. A cost of $0.729 per test strip, plus a pharmacy fee of $7.00 per 100 test strips, was applied. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model was used to forecast the cumulative incidence of diabetes-related complications during a 40-year time horizon, as well as associated costs. For each treatment strategy, inputs for predictive risk factors in the model ― such as hemoglobin A1C, body mass index, and body weight &amp;mdash; were informed by the results of the systematic review and network meta-analysis. Overall hypoglycemia, severe hypoglycemia, and congestive heart failure (regarding TZDs) were also considered in the model.</p>
<p>In the reference-case analysis, the addition of insulin neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) (representing the basal insulin class) to metformin plus a sulfonylurea was associated with the most favourable cost-effectiveness estimates among active treatments, with an incremental cost per QALY gained of $68,442 relative to metformin plus a sulfonylurea alone (see Table 5 of the original guideline document). Other active treatments were more costly and less effective in QALYs gained compared with insulin NPH, with the exception of GLP-1 agonists, which were associated with QALY gains of 8.2957 versus 8.2923 for insulin NPH. Differences between treatments in QALYs were small, hence cost-effectiveness results were driven primarily by lifetime costs. Cost-effectiveness results were sensitive to variation in model inputs and assumptions. In some circumstances, DPP-4 inhibitors became the most cost-effective therapeutic option in circumstances such as if insulin was considered undesirable by patients (i.e., high disutility was applied for insulin injections), if higher rates of hypoglycemia were assumed among patients using insulin than in the reference case analysis, or if a higher disutility was assigned to cases of mild to moderate hypoglycemia. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that the addition of insulin NPH had the highest probability of being the most cost-effective third-line treatment option for willingness-to-pay thresholds above ~$69,000 per QALY gained.</p>
<p>To assess the cost-effectiveness of third-line therapies for patients unable to use insulin, a sensitivity analysis was performed in which insulins were removed as treatment options. In this scenario, the addition of a DPP-4 inhibitor to metformin and a sulfonylurea represented the most cost-effective option, with an incremental cost utility ratio (ICUR) of $113,254 per QALY gained compared with the combination of metformin and a sulfonylurea.</p></div>"/>

<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Harms associated with various second-line antidiabetes drugs were evaluated using the following end points: hypoglycemic events (overall and severe), changes in body weight, and adverse events. Network meta-analyses were conducted for change from baseline in body weight and overall hypoglycemia. Events of severe hypoglycemia and severe adverse events were too rare (e.g., the majority of trials reported zero events) in the included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to perform meaningful comparisons across drug classes. </li>
    <li>Thirty-five RCTs were included in a network meta-analysis for changes from baseline in body weight (N = 20,178). Treatment with sulfonylureas, meglitinides, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), basal insulin, biphasic insulin, and&amp;nbsp;rapid-acting insulin analogue resulted in significantly greater increases in body weight than metformin monotherapy (range 1.7 kg to 3.1 kg), with no significant differences between these classes. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors did not significantly affect body weight. The only drug class associated with a significant reduction in body weight versus metformin monotherapy was glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues (&amp;ndash;1.8 kg, 95% credible interval [CrI], &amp;ndash;3.0 to &amp;ndash;0.5). </li>
    <li>Forty-eight RCTs were included in the updated network meta-analysis for overall hypoglycemia (N = 24,284). Relative to metformin monotherapy, the risk of hypoglycemia was significantly elevated with insulins, sulfonylureas, and meglitinides (odds ratios were 4.1 to 7.0 for insulins, 7.5 for sulfonylureas, and 8.3 for meglitinides). TZDs, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, and GLP-1 analogues were not associated with a significant increase in the risk of hypoglycemia. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Harms of Third-Line Therapy</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Harms associated with various third-line antihyperglycemic drugs were evaluated using the following end points: hypoglycemic events (overall and severe), changes in body weight, and adverse events. A network meta-analysis was conducted for change from baseline in body weight; however, results for overall and severe hypoglycemia could not be pooled in this manner. Events of severe hypoglycemia and severe adverse events were too rare (e.g., the majority of trials reported zero events) in the included RCTs to perform meaningful comparisons across drug classes. </li>
    <li>Eighteen RCTs were included in the updated network meta-analysis for body weight (N = 7,907). When added to metformin and a sulfonylurea, basal insulin, biphasic insulin, rapid-acting insulin analogue, and TZD were associated with significantly greater increases in body weight than occurred with metformin and sulfonylurea alone (range 1.9 kg to 5.0 kg). DPP-4 inhibitors and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors were weight-neutral, whereas GLP-1 analogues were associated with statistically significant weight loss (&amp;ndash;1.6 kg, 95% CrI, &amp;ndash;2.8 to &amp;ndash;0.4). Meglitinides were associated with a non-significant trend toward increased body weight. </li>
    <li>Basal insulin, TZDs, DPP-4 inhibitors, and GLP-1 analogues were associated with a significantly greater risk of overall hypoglycemia than placebo when given in combination with metformin and a sulfonylurea. The various insulin-containing strategies were typically associated with a greater risk of overall hypoglycemia relative to other active comparators. Biphasic and bolus insulins were associated with a significantly greater risk of overall hypoglycemia than basal insulin. Events of severe hypoglycemia were relatively rare for all drug classes, limiting the ability to make meaningful comparisons between drug classes. </li>
