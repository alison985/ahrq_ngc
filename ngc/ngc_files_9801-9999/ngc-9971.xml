	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong>Description of Manufacturer's Search Strategies and Critique</strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer states that searches were undertaken in December 2011 and updated in June 2012. MEDLINE, MEDLINE-in-Process, MEDLINE Daily Update, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched. Additionally, relevant conference proceedings from 2008 to 2012 were searched and clinical trial registers were consulted to identify ongoing studies. Full details of the search strategies are included in Appendix 2 of the manufacturer's submission and are reproducible.</p>
<p>The sources used for the identification of studies were appropriate and the search strategies were comprehensive, incorporating search filters where necessary. Controlled vocabularies and free text searching were used effectively and included a wide range of synonyms. The facets of the search (wet age-related macular degeneration; aflibercept, ranibizumab, bevacizumab; randomised controlled trials), and the synonyms within each facet, were combined correctly with Boolean operators. Overall, the search strategies were highly sensitive and fit for purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>The inclusion criteria used in the systematic review of clinical effectiveness are tabulated in Table 2 of the ERG report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Cost-Effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer economic evaluation of aflibercept for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration is based on a <em>de novo</em> economic model (Markov model) as none of the cost-effectiveness studies identified by the systematic literature review addressed the decision problem.</p></div>"/>

<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Clinical Effectiveness</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Quality Assessment</strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer assessed the quality of all included studies: the&amp;nbsp;two aflibercept randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and the 10 RCTs involving either ranibizumab or aflibercept, which informed the network meta-analysis. The methods used for quality assessment were considered adequate by the ERG.</p>
<p>The methodological quality of the VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 trials was good. Methods used to achieve randomisation were adequate and sequence allocation was concealed using a central interactive voice response system. Randomisation appears to have been successful, and there was not any imbalance between groups in terms of sociodemographic factors at baseline. All patients were masked (blind) to treatment status, and masking was maintained in the aflibercept 2 mg every 8 weeks (Q8) arm by giving sham injections on alternate months. The only study personnel unmasked to treatment status were those involved in the preparation and injection of the study drug. All personnel involved with outcome measurement and assessment were masked. The ERG considers the masking strategies of the VIEW trials appropriate. Although the manufacturer conducted per protocol analysis, the ERG does not consider that this is likely to increase the risk of bias as, for non-inferiority trials, use of the full analysis set is generally not considered to be conservative.</p>
<p>The quality of the other trials included in the indirect analysis was mixed. The report from the Kleijnen Systematic Reviews group, which accompanied the manufacturer's submission, highlighted particular concern with the CATT, DETAIL and MOON trials. The ERG shares this concern over the potential risk of bias of these trials.</p>
<p>The ERG performed a quality assessment of the manufacturer's systematic review using the York Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) criteria (see Table 4 of the ERG report). The quality of the systematic review was good, and the ERG has no major concerns in any of the quality areas.</p>
<p><strong>Meta-Analysis</strong></p>
<p>No meta-analysis of the VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 trials was presented by the manufacturer in their submission. They stated that this was because the two trials were similarly designed so that their data could be pooled directly. The meta-analysis of VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 was, however, presented within the Kleijnen systematic review.</p>
<p><strong>Indirect Comparison &amp;ndash; Summary of Results</strong></p>
<p>The treatment regimen for ranibizumab used in VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 was fixed dose but the manufacturer states that in clinical practice a 'treat to target' approach is used. This involves monthly treatment until the patient's visual acuity (VA) is stable for 3 consecutive months, with re-treatment in a similar way upon loss of VA (with minimum of 2 injections). Therefore the manufacturer commissioned a systematic review by Kleijnen Systematic Reviews group (included in the reference pack of the current submission) to identify studies which included this alternative and then undertook an indirect comparison of the data to compare fixed dose aflibercept (AFB 2 mg Q8) compared with ranibizumab 0.5 mg in a 'reactive dosing' or 'treat as needed' regimen. This type of dosing is referred to as 'pro re nata' (PRN).</p>
<p>The Kleijnen Systematic Reviews group produced three networks for consideration: at 6, 12, and 24 months. However, as no trials reported aflibercept results at 6 months, this network is not discussed further. Figures 1 and 2 of the ERG report display the networks for 12 months and 24 months, respectively.</p>
<p>The Kleijnen Systematic Reviews group undertook three types of indirect comparison: simple Bucher analysis, frequentist network analysis (using STATA) and Bayesian network analysis (using WinBUGS) and the results are now summarised.</p>
<p>See Section 4 of the ERG report for more information on the Kleijnen Systematic Reviews group report, and additional work carried out by ERG.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Cost-effectiveness</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Summary and Critique of Manufacturer's Submitted Economic Evaluation by the ERG</strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer economic evaluation of aflibercept for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration is based on a <em>de novo</em> economic model (Markov model) as none of the cost-effectiveness studies identified by the systematic literature review addressed the decision problem. The <em>de novo</em> economic model developed by the manufacturer is a two-eye model based on the appraisal scope.</p>
<p>See Section 5.2, &quot;NICE Reference Case Checklist,&quot; in the ERG report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><em>Model Structure</em></p>
<p>The model structure is best thought of as a one eye model, with the facility for the development of 2nd eye involvement and the application of some costs and benefits to any 2nd eye involvement. Because of this, the one eye model will be described in detail followed by a description of the modelling of 2nd eye involvement. The ERG has major concerns about the modelling of 2nd eye involvement.</p>
<p>Visual acuity is banded into five health states, with these mostly being 15 letters wide, with the additional health state of death. See Table 23 of the ERG report for visual acuity bands within the model.</p>
<p>Patients begin the model with wet age-related macular degeneration in their 1st eye, and it is assumed that there is no wet age-related macular degeneration and no visual impairment (NVI) in their 2nd eye.</p>
<p>The baseline distribution between the visual acuity bands for the 1st eye is taken from the screening visit of the aflibercept arm of the VIEW 2 trial.</p>
<p>To model the aflibercept arm for year 1, the proportions of patients:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Gaining more than 30 letters </li>
    <li>Gaining 15 to 30 letters </li>
    <li>Remaining within 15 letters </li>
    <li>Losing 15 to 30 letters </li>
    <li>Losing more than 30 letters </li>
</ul>
<p>Between baseline and year 1 are applied to the baseline patient distribution, with the assumption that these proportions apply equally to each health state. To model the aflibercept arm for year 2, the proportions of patients gaining and losing letters between year 1 and year 2 are applied to the estimated patient distribution at year 1. As these are last observation carried forward (LOCF) distributions a proportion of patients are modelled as discontinuing and moving onto best supportive care (BSC) and a proportion of patients are modelled as dying.</p>
<p>The modelling of ranibizumab PRN in year 1 and year 2 follows the same logic, only with the year 1 proportions gaining letters for aflibercept being conditioned by the relative risk of gaining letters to provide estimates for ranibizumab, and the proportion remaining stable being similarly conditioned by the relative risk of maintaining letters. These relative risks are drawn from the Kleijnen systematic review 12 month analyses. The year 1 to year 2 proportions gaining letters and maintaining letters for aflibercept are also conditioned by relative risks, these relative risks are drawn from the Kleijnen systematic review 24 month analyses.</p>
<p>For years 3 to 5 patients are assumed to remain on treatment and have stable visual acuity. But patients on treatment may exit the one eye on treatment model to BSC due to discontinuations. From the start of the third year patients may also develop 2nd eye involvement. From year 6 all patients are assumed to cease treatment and move onto BSC. BSC is associated with a steady loss of visual acuity over time.</p>
<p><em>Sensitivity Analyses</em></p>
<p>A range of univariate sensitivity analyses were presented around resource use, coupled with two sensitivity analyses around the relative risk of improving vision in year 1 and the relative risk of maintaining vision in year 2.</p>
<p>It may have been more sensible to have performed the sensitivity analyses varying the proportion receiving therapy in one stop clinics across all 5 years of treatment, rather than varying it for individual years.</p>
<p><em>Model Validation and Face Validity Check</em></p>
<p>Model validation is limited to comparing the modelled distribution of visual acuity for the study eye for the aflibercept 2 mg Q8 arm with the trial data at baseline, 52 weeks and 96 weeks. The manufacturer response to ERG clarification questions provides the distributions of the treated eyes within the trials, though note that this reporting has switched to the Safety Analysis Set.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Considerations</strong></p>
<p>Technology appraisal recommendations are based on a review of clinical and economic evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Appraisal Process</strong></p>
<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invites &quot;consultee&quot; and &quot;commentator&quot; organisations to take part in the appraisal process. Consultee organisations include national groups representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review. Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to comment on the appraisal documents.</p>
<p>Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service (NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not asked to submit evidence themselves.</p>
<p>NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review published evidence on the technology and prepare an &quot;assessment report&quot;. Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a document called the evaluation report.</p>
<p>An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the &quot;appraisal consultation document&quot; (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE Web site. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.</p>
<p>When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document called the &quot;final appraisal determination&quot; (FAD). This is submitted to NICE for approval.</p>
<p>Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is on the Appraisal Committee?</strong></p>
<p>NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an independent committee. This includes health professionals working in the NHS and people who are familiar with the issues affecting patients and carers. Although the Appraisal Committee seeks the views of organisations representing health professionals, patients, carers, manufacturers and government, its advice is independent of any vested interests.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Summary of Appraisal Committee's Key Conclusions on Cost-Effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Availability and Nature of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The Committee considered the manufacturer's economic model and the Evidence Review Group's (ERG's) critique and exploratory analyses. The Committee agreed with the ERG that it was unrealistic to assume no second-eye involvement in the first 2 years of the model because a large proportion of patients in the VIEW 1 and 2 trials had visual impairment in their second eye at the start of treatment. The Committee concluded that the ERG's exploratory approach, which involved separate analyses depending on whether the study eye was a better-seeing eye or worse-seeing eye, was more reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>Uncertainties Around and Plausibility of Assumptions and Inputs in the Economic Model</strong></p>
<p>The Committee noted the ERG's comments that the manufacturer had applied comparative clinical effectiveness data in terms of visual acuity from its network meta-analyses and indirect comparisons between baseline and 12 months and between 12 months and 24 months rather than between baseline and 12 months and between baseline and 24 months. The Committee agreed with the ERG that the results of the manufacturer's indirect comparison at 24 months provided comparative clinical-effectiveness data between baseline and 24 months, and it concluded that the ERG's exploratory analysis that incorporated this data was the preferred approach.</p>
<p>The Committee concluded that it was reasonable to assume that people in both treatment groups would need 8 treatment visits in the first year of the model in line with the approach taken by the ERG in its exploratory analyses.</p>
<p>The Committee concluded that, based on current clinical practice, it was reasonable to assume that 50% of people in both treatment groups would need separate monitoring visits in line with the approach taken by the ERG in its exploratory analyses.</p>
<p>The Committee concluded that although some uncertainty remained about the true costs involved in treatment and monitoring visits for people with wet age-related macular degeneration, the estimates used in the ERG's exploratory analyses were a fair reflection of the costs involved.</p>
<p><strong>Incorporation of Health-Related Quality-of-Life Benefits and Utility Values/Have Any Potential Significant and Substantial Health-Related Benefits Been Identified That Were Not Included in the Economic Model, and How Have They Been Considered?</strong></p>
<p>No specific conclusions were made by the Committee about health-related quality-of-life benefits and utility values.</p>
<p><strong>Are There Specific Groups of People for Whom the Technology Is Particularly Cost-Effective?</strong></p>
<p>None was identified.</p>
<p><strong>What Are the Key Drivers of Cost-Effectiveness?</strong></p>
<p>The results of the manufacturer's one-way sensitivity analyses indicated that the cost effectiveness of aflibercept was most sensitive to the drug acquisition costs, frequency of injections and monitoring visits, proportion of people in 1-stop and 2-stop models, discount rates and the relative risk of gaining or losing visual acuity with ranibizumab treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Most Likely Cost-Effectiveness Estimate (Given as an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio [ICER])</strong></p>
<p>The Committee noted that its preferred analyses incorporated the confidential discount to the list price of aflibercept and a range of discounts (from 0 to 50%) to the list price of ranibizumab. It also noted that, when discounts to the list price of ranibizumab ranged from 0 to 45%, aflibercept had lower costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) than ranibizumab, which resulted in ICERs for aflibercept compared with ranibizumab ranging from &amp;pound;1,690,000 to &amp;pound;16,700 saved per QALY lost and that, when a 50% discount was applied to the list price of ranibizumab, aflibercept was dominated by ranibizumab in both the worse-seeing eye and better-seeing eye models. However, the Committee was aware that, in both the manufacturer's and the ERG's analyses, the differences in total costs and QALYs were very small.</p></div>"/>
