Refer to the &quot;Guideline Availability&quot; field for information on obtaining the algorithm, as well as the full text of the guideline, which provides additional details.</p>
<p>Levels of evidence (<strong>High, Moderate, Low</strong>) and grades of recommendation (<strong>Strong, Weak, Insufficient</strong>) are defined at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Health maintenance decisions in long term care (LTC) settings should be guided by functional status and probable life expectancy, as well as by the patient's preferences, goals of care, values, and wishes, rather than by age alone. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Low; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>) </li>
    <li>Health maintenance recommendations should be individualized. (In frail older adults, the burdens of some screening tests may outweigh the benefits.) Standard guidelines for preventive care may be inappropriate when applied to frail populations such as the institutionalized elderly. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Low; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>) </li>
    <li>Every LTC facility should implement a system for documenting each patient's prognosis, values, goals, and wishes, as well as any advance directives, so that this information is available in the medical record to facilitate clinical decision making. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Low; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>) </li>
    <li>Every LTC facility should develop a health maintenance protocol for each patient, including individualized goals that can be translated into standing orders for the patient's care. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Low; Strength of Recommendation: Weak</strong>) </li>
    <li>When no preventive intervention approach is clearly medically preferred, the practitioner should explain to the patient and family the risks, benefits, and any alternatives to the intervention and help them to arrive at a reasonable decision to proceed with the intervention or not. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Low; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Recognition</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;6&quot;>
    <li>Following a comprehensive admission assessment, a comprehensive problem list should be prepared for each patient and maintained in the medical record. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Low; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>) </li>
    <li>All patients of LTC facilities should be encouraged to complete advance directives and clarify their treatment preferences. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Low; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>) </li>
    <li>The patient's plan of care should be reviewed and revised as necessary. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Low; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Assessment</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;9&quot;>
    <li>Evaluate the benefits, risks, and the time to benefit from an intervention in the context of the patient's life expectancy, preferences, and goals of care. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Low; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>) </li>
    <li><strong>Screening for dyslipidemia</strong> may be appropriate for older adults who have not previously been screened. Repeat screening at annual intervals, however, is less important in older people because lipid levels are less likely to increase after age 65. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Moderate; Strength of Recommendation: Weak</strong>) </li>
    <li><strong>Osteoporosis screening</strong> may be appropriate for certain individuals in LTC, such as a female patient who is admitted to the facility after a recent hospitalization for hip fracture, has not previously been screened for osteoporosis, and is not already receiving pharmacologic interventions to improve bone density. Although no evidence-based recommendations concerning screening frequency are available, it is reasonable in the LTC setting to screen these patients at least once. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Low; Strength of Recommendation: Weak</strong>) </li>
    <li>Because <strong>vitamin D</strong> insufficiency is common in older adults, it may be advisable to measure 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in selected patients. (However, no established guidelines exist to help in the identification of patients who should be screened for vitamin D deficiency.)

<p><strong>Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The quality of evidence indicates the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect is correct.</p>
<p><strong>High</strong>: At least 1 randomized controlled trial OR 3 pre/post interventions or other prospective interventions or 3 well-structured, relevant observational studies</p>
<p><strong>Moderate</strong>: Studies that use well-tested methods to make comparisons in a fair way, but where the results leave room for uncertainty (e.g., because of the size of the study, losses to follow-up, or the method used for selecting groups for comparison)</p>
<p><strong>Low</strong>: Studies in which the results are doubtful because the study design does not guarantee that fair comparisons can be made</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The strength of a recommendation indicates the extent to which one can be confident that adherence to the recommendation will do more good than harm.</p>

<p>Judgments about the quality of evidence (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field) require assessing the validity of results for important outcomes in individual studies. Explicit criteria should be used in making these judgments. In the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group approach, a systematic review of available evidence guides these judgments.</p>
<p>Sequential judgments are made concerning the following factors:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The quality of evidence across studies for each important outcome </li>
    <li>Which outcomes are critical to a decision </li>
    <li>The overall quality of evidence across these critical outcomes </li>
    <li>The balance between benefits and harms </li>
    <li>The strength of recommendations </li>
</ul>
<p>Reviewers consider four key elements: study design, study quality, consistency, and directness.</p>
<p><strong>Definitions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Study design</strong> refers to the basic study design (broadly, observational studies and randomized trials).</p>
<p><strong>Study quality</strong> refers to the detailed study methods and execution. Appropriate criteria are used to assess study quality for each important outcome. For randomized trials, for example, these criteria might include the adequacy of allocation concealment, blinding, and follow up. Reasons for downgrading a quality rating must be explicit (e.g., failure to blind patients and physicians reduced the quality of evidence for an intervention's impact on pain severity, a serious limitation).</p>
<p><strong>Consistency</strong> refers to the similarity of effect estimates across studies. If there is important unexplained inconsistency in study results, confidence in the effect estimate for that outcome is reduced.</p>
<p><strong>Directness</strong> refers to the extent to which the people, interventions, and outcome measures in the studies are similar to those of interest. For example, the directness of the evidence may be uncertain if the people of interest are older, sicker, or have more comorbidity than those in the studies. To determine whether important uncertainty exists, one can ask whether there is a compelling reason to expect important differences in the effect size. Because many interventions have more or less the same relative effects across most patient groups, reviewers should not use overly stringent criteria in deciding whether evidence is direct.</p>
<p><strong>Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Criteria for <em>decreasing</em> the grade:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Serious (-1) or very serious (-2) limitation to study quality </li>
    <li>Important inconsistency (-1) </li>
    <li>Some (-1) or major (-2) uncertainty about directness </li>
    <li>Imprecise or sparse data (-1) </li>
    <li>High probability of reporting bias (-1) </li>
</ul>
<p>Criteria for<em> increasing</em> the grade:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Strong evidence of association: Significant relative risk greater than 2 (less than 0.5), based on consistent evidence from two or more observational studies, with no plausible confounders (+1) </li>
    <li>Very strong evidence of association: Significant relative risk greater than 5 (less than 0.2), based on direct evidence with no major threats to validity (+2) </li>
    <li>Evidence of a dose-response gradient (+1) </li>
    <li>All plausible confounders would have reduced the effect (+1) </li>
</ul>
<p>These criteria are cumulative &amp;ndash; e.g., if randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have serious limitations and there is uncertainty about the directness of the evidence, the grade of evidence would drop from high to low.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Original guidelines are developed by interdisciplinary workgroups, using a process that combines evidence- and consensus-based approaches. Workgroups include practitioners and others involved in patient care in long term care facilities (LTCs). Beginning with pertinent literature searches for articles and information related to the guideline subject and a draft outline/framework, each group works to develop a concise, usable guideline that is tailored to the LTC setting. Because scientific research in the LTC population is limited, many recommendations are based on findings from research involving community-living older adults. Some recommendations are based on the expert consensus opinion of practitioners and experts in the field of geriatric medicine.</p>
<p>The American Medical Directors Association (AMDA) Clinical Practice Guideline Steering Committee directs the guideline development and revision process. Each year the Steering Committee reviews all AMDA clinical practice guidelines that are 3 years old and commissions a thorough literature review to determine whether the content of each guideline remains current. The AMDA Clinical Practice Committee Chair selects the existing guidelines to be revised and new guidelines to be created based on 1) the Steering Committee's recommendations, 2) data collected, and 3) an assessment of the difficulty of development and relevance to the AMDA membership. AMDA's Board of Directors has final approval over this process.</p>

    <li>The utilization of the AMDA's Clinical Practice Guideline does not preclude compliance with State and Federal regulation as well as facility policies and procedures.

The Clinical Practice Guidelines are not to be considered as standards of care but are developed to enhance the clinicians' ability to practice. </li>
    <li>AMDA guidelines emphasize key care processes and are created to be used in conjunction with facility-specific policies and procedures that guide staff and practitioner practices and performance.

Guideline implementation may be affected by resources available in the facility, including staffing, and will require the involvement of all those in the facility who have a role in patient care. </li>
    <li>Long term care facilities care for a variety of individuals, including younger patients with chronic diseases and disabilities, short-stay patients needing postacute care, and very old and frail individuals suffering from multiple comorbidities. When a workup or treatment is suggested, it is crucial to consider whether such a step is appropriate for a specific individual. A workup may not be indicated if the patient has a terminal or end-stage condition, if it would not change the management course, if the burden of the workup is greater than the potential benefit, or if the patient or his or her legally authorized representative would refuse treatment. It is important to carefully document in the patient's medical record the reasons for decisions not to treat or perform a workup or for choosing one treatment approach over another. </li>
