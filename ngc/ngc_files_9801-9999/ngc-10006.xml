	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.

<p><strong>Genetic Test Interpretation</strong></p>
<p>Clinical genotyping tests are available that interrogate variant <em>cytochrome P450 (CYP)2C19</em> alleles and predict an individual's <em>CYP2C19</em> metabolizer phenotype. Each named star (*) allele is defined by the genotype at one or more specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (see Supplementary Table S1 online [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]) and is associated with a level of enzyme activity (see Supplementary Table S2 online [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). Table 1 below and Supplementary Table S5 online (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) summarize the assignment of the likely <em>CYP2C19</em> phenotype based on common star allele diplotypes, and these assignments are used to link genotypes with personalized antiplatelet therapy.</p>

<p><strong>Therapeutic Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines are designed to help clinicians understand how available genetic test results can be used to optimize drug therapy rather than to recommend in whom pharmacogenetic testing should be conducted. With the growing ease and availability of genetic testing and other sequencing programs, an increasing number of patients in the near future may already know their <em>CYP2C19</em> genotype status at the time of treatment, and this document provides guidance on clinical management for those in whom genotype is available or for whom the clinician chooses to order a <em>CYP2C19</em> genotyping test. With respect to other professional statements, the 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association acute coronary syndrome (ACS) guidelines noted that genetic testing for <em>CYP2C19</em> loss-of-function alleles may be considered on a case-by-case basis, especially for patients who experience recurrent ACS events despite ongoing therapy with clopidogrel. In addition, the committee recommended that genotyping might be considered if results of testing may alter management, which they suggest until better clinical evidence exists to provide a more scientifically derived recommendation.</p>
<p>Optimal individualized antiplatelet treatment should maximize benefit by reducing risk of recurrent cardiovascular (CV) events while minimizing adverse effects such as bleeding. Prasugrel is an approved antiplatelet agent that was superior to clopidogrel in a large-scale randomized trial of ACS patients with planned percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), with a hazards ratio (HR) for CV death, myocardial infarction, or stroke for prasugrel vs. clopidogrel of 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.73&amp;ndash;0.90, <em>P</em> &amp;lt;0.001), as well as a 42% reduction in stent thrombosis. However, it may not represent a substitute for clopidogrel in all patients due to an increased risk of non-coronary artery bypass grafting thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) major bleeding (HR = 1.32, 95% CI =1.03&amp;ndash;1.68; <em>P</em> = 0.03), including fatal bleeding (prasugrel = 0.4% vs. clopidogrel = 0.1%; <em>P </em>= 0.002); its contraindication in some patients (e.g., history of transient ischemic attack, stroke, or intracranial bleeding); and the lower expense of generic clopidogrel following the recent expiration of its patent. Of note, the benefit of prasugrel over clopidogrel was found to be greater in patients with a <em>CYP2C19</em> loss-of-function allele, with no significant difference estimated in composite outcome risk between the two antiplatelet agents among <em>CYP2C19</em> extensive metabolizers (i.e., <em>*1/*1</em> patients).</p>
<p>In addition to prasugrel, ticagrelor is a recently approved antiplatelet agent that also was superior to clopidogrel in a large-scale randomized trial of ACS patients with an HR for CV death, myocardial infarction, or stroke for ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel of 0.84 (95% CI = 0.77&amp;ndash;0.92; <em>P</em> &amp;lt;0.001), including a 26% reduction in stent thrombosis and 18% reduction in all-cause mortality. In the genetic substudy, as compared with clopidogrel, ticagrelor reduced the primary end point by 23% among patients carrying any <em>CYP2C19</em> loss-of-function allele (8.6 vs. 11.2%; HR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.60&amp;ndash;0.99; <em>P</em> = 0.0380) and 14% among patients without any <em>CYP2C19</em> loss-of-function allele (8.8 vs. 10.0%; HR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.74&amp;ndash;1.01), although this reduction did not reach statistical significance (<em>P</em> = 0.0608). However, formal interaction testing that evaluated if the effect of ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel varied by genotype was also not significant. Of note, the benefit of ticagrelor as compared with clopidogrel was subsequently shown to appear to be most pronounced among the subset of patients with <em>CYP2C19</em> loss-of-function alleles who were undergoing PCI (carriers: 7.7 vs. 10.6%, HR = 0.71; noncarriers: 7.4 vs. 8.2%, HR = 0.90). In addition, it is not known to what extent twice-daily dosing may affect the efficacy of ticagrelor relative to clopidogrel in a real-world setting.</p>
<p>Despite the improvements in overall efficacy reported for prasugrel and ticagrelor as compared with clopidogrel, it is anticipated that clopidogrel will continue to be a widely prescribed medication for ACS/PCI patients. Genotype-directed therapy could identify patients who benefit most from alternative antiplatelet therapy. For clinicians considering treatment with clopidogrel, Table 2 below and Figure 1 in the original guideline document summarize the therapeutic recommendations for antiplatelet therapy based on <em>CYP2C19</em> status. Standard dosing of clopidogrel, as recommended in the product insert, is warranted among ACS/PCI patients with a predicted <em>CYP2C19</em> extensive metabolizer or ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype (i.e., <em>*1/*1, *1/*17</em>, and <em>*17/*17</em>). If genotyping from a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments&amp;ndash;certified laboratory identifies a patient as a <em>CYP2C19</em> poor metabolizer (PM) (i.e., <em>*2/*2</em>), current literature supports the use of an alternative antiplatelet agent (e.g., prasugrel or ticagrelor) when not contraindicated clinically.</p>
<p>The most challenging patient population to address is the <em>CYP2C19</em> intermediate metabolizer (IM) phenotype (e.g., <em>*1/*2, *1/*3</em>, and <em>*2/*17</em>). IMs have higher on-treatment residual platelet activity on average as compared with extensive metabolizers, and ACS/PCI <em>CYP2C19*2</em> heterozygotes treated with clopidogrel have increased risks for serious adverse CV outcomes, including stent thrombosis (see Supplementary Materials and Methods online [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). Consequently, these data support switching to an alternative antiplatelet agent for IMs when not contraindicated. However, given the wide interindividual variability in residual platelet activity observed among clopidogrel-treated IMs, clinical judgment also taking into account other factors that may place an IM at increased risk of a CV event (or adverse bleeding event) must be considered to most effectively individualize therapy.</p>
<p>In addition, although these guidelines have been focused on <em>CYP2C19*2</em> and <em>*3</em>, many clinical genotyping platforms include other variant alleles (e.g., <em>*4</em>&amp;ndash;<em>*8</em> and <em>*17</em>) that can alter a patient's predicted metabolizer phenotype interpretation (see Supplementary Table S5 online [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). As mentioned above, the <em>*4&amp;ndash;*8</em> alleles have strong <em>in vitro</em> evidence for complete loss of function of the <em>CYP2C19</em> enzyme. Consequently, when these alleles are identified among ACS/PCI patients treated with clopidogrel, they should be considered as influencing clopidogrel metabolism and clinical outcomes consistent with the <em>*2</em> loss-of-function allele.</p>

<p><strong>Caveats: Appropriate Use and/or Potential Misuse of Genetic Tests</strong></p>
<p>If pursuing <em>CYP2C19</em> genotyping, one of the challenges is the need for rapid turnaround time of results. It would be advantageous to have the results before initiating antiplatelet therapy because the majority of potentially preventable recurrent events occur early in treatment. For example, among other clinical and genetic factors, <em>CYP2C19*2</em> has recently been associated with definite early stent thrombosis in a case&amp;ndash;control study. Therefore, if <em>CYP2C19</em> genotype is not already known from prior testing, early testing and expedited reporting would be advantageous. To address this issue, point-of-care genetic testing systems have been developed (see Supplementary Materials and Methods online; see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field), and some academic medical centers have deployed preemptive genotyping programs for selected patient populations.</p>
<p>Of note, as described above, these recommendations apply predominantly to ACS patients undergoing PCI. Current data do not support the use of <em>CYP2C19</em> genotype data to guide treatment in other scenarios. In addition, at the time of this writing, there are no data available on the possible role of <em>CYP2C19</em> in clopidogrel response in pediatric patient populations; however, there is no reason to suspect that <em>CYP2C19</em> variant alleles would affect clopidogrel metabolism differently in children as compared with adults.</p>
