These medicines carry serious risks, including slowed or difficult breathing and death, which appear to be a greater risk in children younger than 12 years, and should not be used in these children. These medicines should also be limited in some older children. Single-ingredient codeine and all tramadol-containing products are FDA-approved only for use in adults.

                <li>Educate patients on the need to take the medication daily and according to the prescribed frequency and dosage. </li>
                <li>Ensure that patients have realistic expectations as to what the likely benefits of pharmacological prophylaxis will be. That is:
                <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
                    <li>Headache attacks will likely not be abolished completely. </li>
                    <li>A reduction in headache frequency of 50% is usually considered worthwhile and successful. </li>
                    <li>It may take 4 to 8 weeks for significant benefit to occur. </li>
                    <li>If the prophylactic drug provides significant benefit in the first 2 months of therapy, this may increase further over several additional months of therapy. </li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Evaluate the effectiveness of therapy through the use of patient diaries that record headache frequency, drug use, and disability levels. </li>
                <li>For most prophylactic drugs, initiate therapy with a low dose and increase the dosage gradually to minimize side effects. </li>
                <li>Increase the dose until the drug proves effective, until dose-limiting side effects occur, or a target dose is reached. </li>
                <li>Provide an adequate drug trial. Unless side effects mandate discontinuation, continue the prophylactic drug for at least 6 to 8 weeks after dose titration is completed. </li>
                <li>Because migraine attack tendency fluctuates over time, gradual discontinuation of the drug should be considered for many patients after 6 to 12 months of successful prophylactic therapy, but preventive medications can be continued for much longer in patients who have experienced significant migraine-related disability. </li>

Sumatriptan should not be used routinely in pregnancy, but may be considered for use when other medications have failed and the benefits outweigh the risks. There is much less information or experience available regarding the safety of the other triptans during pregnancy.</p>

Expanding their repertoire of adaptive coping strategies may facilitate reduction of medication use and ultimate improvement in headache. </li>

            <p>Pharmacological prophylaxis should be considered in patients with suspected medication overuse headache, with the prophylactic medication started prior to or during medication withdrawal. Many migraine prophylactics are used (beta-blockers, tricyclics, and others) but topiramate (with the drug titrated slowly to a target dose of 100 mg daily, see migraine prophylaxis section), and OnabotulinumtoxinA (100 to 200 Units injected at intervals of 3 months by clinicians experienced in its use for headache) have the best evidence for efficacy in the setting of chronic migraine with medication overuse.</p>

<p><strong>Inclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p><em>Guidelines</em></p>
<p>Guidelines (&quot;seed&quot; guidelines) were included if they focused on the diagnosis, conservative nonsurgical treatment, or prevention of primary headache and were designed for use in primary healthcare settings by physicians, physical therapists, chiropractors, occupational therapists, nurses, community-based nurses, pharmacists, mental health professionals, and other healthcare providers who treat patients with headache.</p>
<p>Only clinical practice guideline (CPGs) formulated in countries with developed market economies were included since the health status, cultural norms, access to health care, and disease burden of individuals from countries with transitional or developing economies were likely to be too different from those in Canada to be clinically relevant. Countries deemed to have developed economies, as defined by the United Nations, were Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the United States of America, and European countries (except for those with transition economies).</p>
<p><em>Patient Group</em></p>
<p>Patients included individuals aged 18 years or older. Guidelines that referred to adult patients or focused on headache in pregnant women without providing a specific age range were also included on the basis that the majority of the populations in these guidelines were likely to be at least 18 years of age.</p>
<p><em>Condition</em></p>
<p>For guidelines on treatment and diagnosis, only those that used the diagnostic criteria developed by the International Headache Society were included.</p>
<p>Guidelines were included if they dealt with the prevention, diagnosis and investigation, and treatment of primary headache that is not related to or caused by another disorder. These headache types include migraine, tension-type, and cluster headache as well as other primary headaches (thunderclap headache, hemicranias continua, new daily-persistent headache). Other trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, such as chronic paroxysmal hemicranias and short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) or cranial autonomic features (SUNA), were excluded because of their low incidence.</p>
<p>Guidelines on medication-overuse headache (secondary headache) were also included because this headache type is typically present in a subgroup of patients with primary headache who have over-medicated. Cervicogenic headaches (secondary headache) were also included because a significant number of patients present to primary care physicians with this malady. Headache related with temporomandibular disorder is briefly discussed. However, other secondary headaches related to a causative disorder, such as trauma or infection, were excluded.</p>
<p><strong>Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Guidelines were excluded that focused on diagnostic techniques, interventions, or treatments applied in the emergency department or inpatient setting (for example, surgical treatments).</p>
<p>Also excluded were guidelines focused on children or adolescents, or patients with specific causes for headache, such as head or neck trauma (except for cervicogenic headache), cranial or cervical vascular disorders, non-vascular intracranial disorders (for example, neoplasm or idiopathic intracranial hypertension), use of a substance or its withdrawal (except for secondary medication-overuse headache), temporomandibular joint disorder, infection, disorders of homeostasis, psychiatric disorders, or disorders or lesions of the cranium, neck, eyes, ears, nose, sinuses, teeth, mouth, or other facial or cranial structures.</p>
<p><strong>Literature Search Strategies</strong></p>
<p>A preliminary systematic literature search was conducted to identify relevant guidelines published in English between January 2000 and April 2006. The search was further refined and updates were conducted in April 2009, October 2009, August 2010, and May 2011 (Table 1 in the background document [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). The date restriction was applied to ensure the guidelines collected were current and clinically relevant.</p>
<p>Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) relevant to this topic are: headache; Headache disorders.</p>
<p>In some cases, Guideline Development Group (GDG) members requested additional research evidence to finalize some of the Alberta CPG recommendations, so primary studies cited in the seed guidelines in support of their recommendations were retrieved for closer examination. For some of these recommendations, a database of systematic reviews on headache disorders (known as the Institute of Health Economics [IHE] database), which was created for the Ambassador Project in 2006, was searched for systematic reviews published in English between January 2000 and October 2010. The IHE database was updated in January 2007, May 2007, March 2009, November 2009, March 2010, and October 2010. The search strategy for the systematic reviews in this database is outlined in Table 2 in the background document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><em>New Interventions and Recommendations</em></p>
<p>The IHE database was searched to identify recently published systematic reviews of new interventions that were considered important by the GDG, but that were not covered in the seed guidelines. These included duloxetine and desvenlafaxine for migraine prophylaxis. Occasionally, new recommendations were generated when the GDG members requested and reviewed additional research evidence. In some cases, the IHE database was searched for systematic reviews on these particular interventions, which included normobaric oxygen for migraine and exercise for migraine, tension-type, and cervicogenic headache (see Appendix H in the background document [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]).</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Selecting the Seed Guidelines</strong></span></p>
<p>The initial selection of guidelines was made by one reviewer and double-checked by a second reviewer. Guidelines were excluded that, on the basis of their abstract, clearly did not meet the inclusion criteria. Copies of the full text of potentially eligible guidelines were retrieved. In some cases, closer examination of the full text revealed that the guideline did not meet the inclusion criteria. Consequently, these papers were excluded (see Appendix C in the background document [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). When a single guideline development group had published more than one guideline, only the most recent version was used. From the 64 relevant guidelines identified by the search strategy, the IHE Research Team, in consultation with one GDG co-chair, compiled a final shortlist of 18 potential seed guidelines.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Critically Appraising the Seed Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>The included guidelines were assessed with respect to various aspects of methodology and reporting using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument. Although a new edition of the tool, AGREE tool (II), was published in May 2009, to maintain consistency and continuity in the guideline appraisal process, the Research Team decided to continue using the original AGREE tool that had been used in the first and second editions of another Alberta Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on low back pain.</p>
<p>The AGREE instrument is an internationally developed, generic tool that is validated, transparent, and widely accepted, with satisfactory reliability for most domains. The instrument has 23 key items organized into six domains. The Research Team modified the AGREE tool to reduce the ambiguity and subjectivity associated with item scoring, and to enable the differentiation of good quality guidelines from poor quality guidelines. A detailed discussion of the modifications can be found in the background document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p>Seed guideline quality assessments were undertaken independently by two reviewers who discussed the modified AGREE dictionary with respect to the interpretation of questions prior to assessing the guidelines. Reviewers discussed any items where the scores differed by at least two points to minimize coding bias.</p>
<p><strong>Extracting Data</strong></p>
<p>Two reviewers extracted guideline information into standardized evidence inventory tables that were developed a priori. However, duplicate data extraction and cross-checking were not performed. The evidence inventory tables included:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Guideline profile information (title, country, intervention category: for example, diagnosis, prophylaxis, pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical treatment) </li>
    <li>A synopsis of the recommendations </li>
    <li>A list of the number and types of studies referenced by the guideline to support its recommendations </li>
</ul>
<p>Discordant recommendations among guidelines were highlighted within the table. After consultation with the SC, the strength of the recommendations, as stated by the seed guidelines, was added to the evidence inventory tables for recommendations on tension-type, cluster, and medication-overuse headache.</p>
<p>Additional research evidence and information was required, particularly when recommendations were overlapping, discordant, or absent. These supplementary requests by the Guideline Development Group (GDG), named &quot;parking lot&quot; items, necessitated examination of the individual studies cited by the seed guideline(s) or examination of other research evidence, that is, systematic reviews on headache identified by a supplementary search of literature (Institute of Health [IHE] Database) published between January 2000 and October 2010 (see Table 2 in the background document [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). An article was deemed to be a systematic review if it met all of the following criteria:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Focused clinical question </li>
    <li>Explicit search strategy </li>
    <li>Use of explicit, reproducible, and uniformly applied criteria for article selection </li>
    <li>Critical appraisal of the included studies </li>
    <li>Qualitative or quantitative data synthesis </li>
</ul>
<p>Only systematic reviews that focused on the diagnosis, nonsurgical treatment, or prevention of primary headache among adults in the primary care setting were considered. When no systematic review was available for a specific intervention, information was considered from the most recent quasi-systematic review (defined as a review that did not critically appraise the included studies) or narrative review listed in the systematic review database.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The Guideline Development Group (GDG) reviewed all the documents for the seed guidelines (the guidelines plus their companion documents, evidence inventory tables, and AGREE scores) and engaged in deliberations during 13 half-day meetings (one face-to-face and 12 web conferences) over a 23-month period. The agenda and all documents were provided in advance and participants had the option of joining in via telephone if an Internet connection was not available. Two experienced co-chairs guided all the meetings. Roundtables were conducted during each meeting to ensure that all participants had a voice in the proceedings and that process reviews were instigated at strategic points throughout. Each of the topic areas (diagnosis and investigation, interventions for migraine, tension-type headache, cluster headache, and medication-overuse headache) were addressed in a sequential fashion to ensure there were separate discussions on the formulation of recommendations for each.</p>
<p>In many cases, one co-chair (a neurologist with expertise in headache management) created &quot;straw dog&quot; recommendations, based on the seed guideline recommendations, prior to the GDG discussions. These, along with the relevant evidence inventory tables, were then reviewed at the GDG meeting. After GDG meetings, the same co-chair refined or reworded recommendations based on the feedback received from participants. This additional work by the co-chair served to focus discussion and promote consensus on recommendation wording. The red flags and referral recommendations were reviewed by two external experts, one with expertise in emergency medicine and the other with an expertise in ophthalmology. Input on the recommendations for diagnosis and neuroimaging was also obtained from two external radiology experts. All final decisions were made by consensus (see Appendix B of the background document for a flow diagram of the guideline development process [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]).</p>
<p>Additional evidence was required when there were uncertainties or disagreements arose regarding interpretation of the evidence from the seed guidelines or when new interventions were considered that had not been included in the seed guidelines. These contentious items were referred for further analysis to ad hoc GDG subcommittees comprising one or both GDG co-chairs, one health technology assessment (HTA) researcher, and at least one volunteer from the GDG with expertise in the relevant area (see Figure 1 in the background document [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). When necessary, additional information was provided from individual studies cited by the seed guidelines or from systematic reviews listed in a regularly updated database of reviews on headache disorders (Institute of Health Economics [IHE] Database). All of the consensus-based subcommittee decisions were presented to the GDG for final approval.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale and Process for Developing Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Each recommendation from the Alberta clinical practice guideline (CPG) was sourced from one or multiple seed guidelines and was accepted, supplemented, or changed as follows:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Accepted or accepted with minor modification (for example, wording) </li>
    <li>Accepted but supplemented with expert opinion </li>
    <li>Additional information retrieved/considered, specifically:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Original recommendation accepted/changed based only on studies included in seed guidelines </li>
        <li>Original recommendation accepted/changed based on additional evidence from systematic review literature search </li>
        <li>Additional evidence supplemented with expert opinion </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, each recommendation in the Alberta CPG came from one or more seed guideline(s), was based on evidence from systematic or quasi-systematic reviews, or was created by the GDG, based on their collective professional opinion and an analysis of relevant evidence.</p></div>"/>

<p>The Evidence Source provides information on the &quot;seed&quot; guideline(s) that were used to develop the Alberta guideline recommendations and the design of the studies referenced by the &quot;seed&quot; guideline(s) in support of their recommendations. The following evidence sources were considered:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Systematic review (SR): as cited by the &quot;seed&quot; guideline(s) or identified from a supplementary literature search (Institute of Health Economics [IHE] Database) required by the Ambassador Guideline Development Group (GDG). The literature search for relevant guidelines spanned from January 2000 until May 2011 while the literature search for published systematic reviews spanned from January 2000 to October 2010. A review which does not include a critical appraisal of the included studies is considered a quasi-systematic review (qSR). </li>
    <li>Randomized controlled trial (RCT): as cited by the &quot;seed&quot; guideline(s). </li>
    <li>Non-randomized comparative study (NRCS): non-randomized trial with concurrent or historical controls, case-control study, or a study of the sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test as cited by the &quot;seed&quot; guideline(s). </li>
    <li>Case series (CS): cross-sectional study, case series study, or case report as cited by the &quot;seed&quot; guideline(s). </li>
    <li>Guideline (G): as cited by the &quot;seed&quot; guideline(s). </li>
    <li>Narrative review (NR): narrative review, or consensus statement or report as cited by the &quot;seed&quot; guideline(s). </li>
    <li>Expert opinion (EO) as cited by the &quot;seed&quot; guideline(s): when no evidence was provided by the &quot;seed&quot; guideline in support of the recommendation. </li>
    <li>EO (GDG): after examining other references nominated by the GDG members (i.e., SRs, NR, RCTs, Gs) or when no evidence from SRs was found on an intervention, a new recommendation was drafted based on the collective EO of the Ambassador GDG. </li>
</ul>
<p>For evidence cited by the &quot;seed&quot; guideline(s), only the highest level of evidence was listed. For example, when the evidence cited by a &quot;seed&quot; guideline(s) was from SRs and studies of other design (i.e., qSR, RCT, NRCS, CS, G, or NR) only SR is listed as the source. When no SR was referenced in the &quot;seed&quot; guideline, the evidence source was indicated in the following order: qSR, RCT, NRCS, CS, G, NR, EO. The same classification for the evidence source was applied when multiple &quot;seed&quot; guidelines were used to inform one recommendation.</p>
<p>Each recommendation in the Alberta guideline came from one or more &quot;seed&quot; guideline(s) or SRs/qSRs (IHE Database) or was created by the GDG, based on their collective professional opinion and an analysis of relevant evidence.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Dissemination and Implementation Plan</strong></p>
<p>The Alberta Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) for Primary Care Management of Headache in Adults dissemination plan includes five main strategies to manage barriers.</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Develop patient support materials (information sheets, website). </li>
    <li>Involve partners:
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
        <li>Toward Optimized Practice (TOP) to launch guideline. </li>
        <li>Guideline Development Group (GDG) to champion the CPG in their regions/zones. </li>
        <li>Advisory Committee members to champion through their organizations. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Facilitate access to the Alberta CPG on the TOP website from provincial, national, and international associations and organizations. </li>
    <li>Contact and connect with important stakeholders such as Alberta Health, Alberta Health Services, and the primary care networks. </li>
    <li>Promote the CPG to professionals through different channels such as workshops, teaching support for continuing medical education (CME) in faculties of medicine (Calgary and Edmonton), rural CME sessions, videoconferences, webinars, participation at conferences and other professional meetings, and publication in professional newsletters and peer-reviewed Canadian and international journals. </li>
</ol>
<p>A repository document was created for logging the knowledge translation activities conducted before and after the launch of the Alberta CPG. The document, which is continuously updated, includes information on the type of activity (what, who, when, where), its objective, the intended audience, and any evaluation or feedback received.</p></div>"/>
