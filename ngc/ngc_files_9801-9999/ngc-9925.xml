	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

ArchiveBot's source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot">https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot</a>.

    <li>In people with GFR &amp;lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (GFR categories G3a&amp;ndash;G5), the Work Group recommends that serum concentrations of troponin be interpreted with caution with respect to diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. (<strong>1B</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Non-invasive Testing</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that people with CKD presenting with chest pain should be investigated for underlying cardiac disease and other disorders according to the same local practice for people without CKD (and subsequent treatment should be initiated similarly). (<strong>1B</strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests that clinicians are familiar with the limitations of non-invasive cardiac tests (e.g., exercise electrocardiography [ECG], nuclear imaging, echocardiography, etc.) in adults with CKD and interpret the results accordingly. (<strong>2B</strong>) </li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>Medication Management and Patient Safety in CKD</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that prescribers should take GFR into account when drug dosing. (<strong>1A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Where precision is required for dosing (due to narrow therapeutic or toxic range) and/or estimates may be unreliable (e.g., due to low muscle mass), the Work Group recommends methods based upon cystatin C or direct measurement of GFR. (<strong>1C</strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends temporary discontinuation of potentially nephrotoxic and renally excreted drugs in people with a GFR &amp;lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (GFR categories G3a&amp;ndash;G5) who have serious intercurrent illness that increases the risk of AKI. These agents include, but are not limited to: RAAS blockers (including ACE-Is, ARBs, aldosterone inhibitors, direct renin inhibitors), diuretics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), metformin, lithium, and digoxin. (<strong>1C</strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that adults with CKD seek medical or pharmacist advice before using over-the-counter medicines or nutritional protein supplements. (<strong>1B</strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends not using herbal remedies in people with CKD. (<strong>1B</strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that metformin be continued in people with GFR &amp;ge;45 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (GFR categories G1&amp;ndash;G3a); its use should be reviewed in those with GFR 30&amp;ndash;44 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (GFR category G3b); and it should be discontinued in people with GFR &amp;lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (GFR categories G4&amp;ndash;G5). (<strong>1C</strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that all people taking potentially nephrotoxic agents such as lithium and calcineurin inhibitors should have their GFR, electrolytes and drug levels regularly monitored. (<strong>1A</strong>) </li>
    <li>People with CKD should not be denied therapies for other conditions such as cancer but there should be appropriate dose adjustment of cytotoxic drugs according to knowledge of GFR. (<strong>Not Graded</strong>) </li>

<p><em>Radiocontrast</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that all people with GFR &amp;lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (GFR categories G3a&amp;ndash;G5) undergoing elective investigation involving the intravascular administration of iodinated radiocontrast media should be managed according to the NGC summary of the <a href=&quot;/content.aspx?id=38024&quot; title=&quot;Guideline #9267&quot;>KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury</a>:

</ul>
<p><em>Gadolinium-based Contrast Media</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The Work Group recommends not using gadolinium-containing contrast media in people with GFR &amp;lt;15 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (GFR category G5) unless there is no alternative appropriate test. (<strong>1B</strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests that people with a GFR &amp;lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (GFR categories G4&amp;ndash;G5) who require gadolinium-containing contrast media are preferentially offered a macrocyclic chelate preparation. (<strong>2B</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bowel Preparation</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>

<p><strong>CKD and Risk of Infections, AKI, Hospitalizations, and Mortality</strong></p>
<p><em>CKD and Risk of Infections</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that all adults with CKD are offered annual vaccination with influenza vaccine, unless contraindicated. (<strong>1B</strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that all adults with eGFR &amp;lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (GFR categories G4&amp;ndash;G5) and those at high risk of pneumococcal infection (e.g., nephrotic syndrome, diabetes, or those receiving immunosuppression) receive vaccination with polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine unless contraindicated. (<strong>1B</strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that all adults with CKD who have received pneumococcal vaccination are offered revaccination within 5 years. (<strong>1B</strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that all adults who are at high risk of progression of CKD and have GFR &amp;lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (GFR categories G4&amp;ndash;G5) be immunized against hepatitis B and the response confirmed by appropriate serological testing. (<strong>1B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Consideration of live vaccine should include an appreciation of the patient's immune status and should be in line with recommendations from official or governmental bodies. (<strong>Not Graded</strong>) </li>
    <li>Pediatric immunization schedules should be followed according to official international and regional recommendations for children with CKD. (<strong>Not Graded</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><em>CKD and Risk of AKI</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that all people with CKD are considered to be at increased risk of AKI. (<strong>1A</strong>)
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>In people with CKD, the recommendations detailed in the NGC summary of the KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury should be followed for management of those at risk of AKI during intercurrent illness, or when undergoing investigation and procedures that are likely to increase the risk of AKI.

<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Referral to Specialists and Models of Care</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Referral to Specialist Services</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The Work Group recommends referral to specialist kidney care services for people with CKD in the following circumstances (<strong>1B</strong>):
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>AKI or abrupt sustained fall in GFR </li>
        <li>GFR &amp;lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (GFR categories G4&amp;ndash;G5)* </li>
        <li>A consistent finding of significant albuminuria (ACR &amp;ge;300 mg/g [&amp;ge;30 mg/mmol] or AER &amp;ge;300 mg/24 hours, approximately equivalent to PCR &amp;ge;500 mg/g [&amp;ge;50 mg/mmol] or PER &amp;ge;500 mg/24 hours) </li>
        <li>Progression of CKD (see above for definition) </li>
        <li>Urinary red cell casts, red blood cells (RBCs) &amp;gt;20 per high power field sustained and not readily explained </li>
        <li>CKD and hypertension refractory to treatment with 4 or more antihypertensive agents </li>
        <li>Persistent abnormalities of serum potassium </li>
        <li>Recurrent or extensive nephrolithiasis </li>
        <li>Hereditary kidney disease </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends timely referral for planning renal replacement therapy (RRT) in people with progressive CKD in whom the risk of kidney failure within 1 year is 10% to 20% or higher&amp;dagger;, as determined by validated risk prediction tools. (<strong>1B</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p>See Figure 21 in the original guideline document for information on referral decision making by GFR and albuminuria.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*If this is a stable isolated finding, formal referral (i.e., formal consultation and ongoing care management) may not be necessary and advice from specialist services may be all that is required to facilitate best care for the patients. This will be health-care system dependent.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>&amp;dagger;The aim is to avoid late referral, defined here as referral to specialist services less than 1 year before start of RRT.</p>
<p><strong>Care of the Patient with Progressive CKD</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The Work Group suggests that people with progressive CKD should be managed in a multidisciplinary care setting. (<strong>2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>The multidisciplinary team should include or have access to dietary counseling, education and counseling about different RRT modalities, transplant options, vascular access surgery, and ethical, psychological, and social care. (<strong>Not Graded</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Timing the Initiation of RRT</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The Work Group suggests that dialysis be initiated when one or more of the following are present: symptoms or signs attributable to kidney failure (serositis, acid-base or electrolyte abnormalities, pruritus); inability to control volume status or blood pressure; a progressive deterioration in nutritional status refractory to dietary intervention; or cognitive impairment. This often but not invariably occurs in the GFR range between 5 and 10 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. (<strong>2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Living donor preemptive renal transplantation in adults should be considered when the GFR is &amp;lt;20 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and there is evidence of progressive and irreversible CKD over the preceding 6&amp;ndash;12 months. (<strong>Not Graded</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Structure and Process of Comprehensive Conservative Management</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Conservative management should be an option in people who choose not to pursue RRT and this should be supported by a comprehensive management program. (<strong>Not Graded</strong>) </li>
    <li>All CKD programs and care providers should be able to deliver advance care planning for people with a recognized need for end-of-life care, including those people undergoing conservative kidney care. (<strong>Not Graded</strong>) </li>
    <li>Coordinated end-of-life care should be available to people and families through either primary care or specialist care as local circumstances dictate. (<strong>Not Graded</strong>) </li>
    <li>The comprehensive conservative management program should include protocols for symptom and pain management, psychological care, spiritual care, and culturally sensitive care for the dying patient and their family (whether at home, in a hospice or a hospital setting), followed by the provision of culturally appropriate bereavement support.

<p>Search strategies were developed by the Evidence Review Team (ERT), with input from the Work Group, for each topic of interest (whether treatment or non-treatment topics). The ERT performed literature searches and conducted abstract and article screening. The ERT also coordinated the methodological and analytic processes, data extraction, and summarizing of the evidence. Before initiating the ERT's own <em>de novo</em> systematic review, the ERT searched for existing systematic reviews that could be used. The searches and search terms are provided in Supplemental Table 1 (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) and the search dates and yields for all topics are presented in Table 38 of the original guideline document. The search was updated through June 2011 and supplemented by articles identified by Work Group members through November 2012.</p>
<p><strong>Selection of Outcomes of Interest</strong></p>
<p>The Work Group selected outcomes of interest on the basis of their importance for informing clinical decision making. Importance of mortality and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) was considered to be critical; the importance of progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and categorical or continuous measures of kidney function was considered to be high; and the importance of quality of life (QOL), blood pressure (BP), gout attacks, and proteinuria was considered to be moderate.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations of Approach</strong></p>
<p>Although the literature searches were intended to be comprehensive, they were not exhaustive. MEDLINE was the only database searched. Hand searches of journals were not performed, and review articles and textbook chapters were not systematically searched. However, important studies known to domain experts that were missed by the electronic literature searches were added to the retrieved articles and reviewed by the Work Group.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Data Extraction</strong></p>
<p>Text articles were extracted by the Evidence Review Team (ERT) onto forms customized to capture data on design, methodology, baseline characteristics, interventions or predictors, comparators, outcomes, results, and limitations of individual studies. Study methodology and risk of bias were also systematically graded for each outcome and recorded.</p>
<p><strong>Summary Tables</strong></p>
<p>Pertinent information for systematic review topics was tabulated in summary tables. Summary tables list outcomes of interest as well as relevant population characteristics, descriptions of interventions and comparators, results, and quality grades for each outcome. Categorical and continuous outcomes were summarized separately. Work Group members reviewed all summary table data and quality grades.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Profiles</strong></p>
<p>Evidence profiles are usually constructed as a means to assess the quality and record quality grades and descriptions of effect for each outcome across studies, as well as the quality grades and description of net benefits or harms of the intervention or comparator across studies. These profiles aim to make the evidence synthesis process transparent. However, since no treatment or non-treatment topic had more than one study in a summary table for which the quality was graded, no evidence profiles were generated, and the information in the summary table shows the highest level of synthesis.</p>
<p><strong>Grading of Quality of Evidence for Outcomes of Individual Studies</strong></p>
<p>Methodological quality (internal validity) refers to the design, conduct, and reporting of outcomes of a clinical study. A previously devised three-level classification system for quality assessment was used to grade the overall study quality and quality of all relevant outcomes in the study (see Table 39 in the original guideline document). Variations of this system have been used in most Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) and all Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines and have been recommended for the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Evidence-based Practice Center program.</p>
<p>Each study was given an overall quality grade on the basis of its design, methodology (randomization, allocation, blinding, definition of outcomes, appropriate use of statistical methods, etc.), conduct (drop-out percentage, outcome assessment methodologies, etc.), and reporting (internal consistency, clarity, thoroughness, and precision, etc.). Each reported outcome was then evaluated and given an individual grade depending on the quality of reporting and methodological issues specific to that outcome. However, the quality grade of an individual outcome could not exceed the quality grade for the overall study.</p>
<p><strong>Grading the Quality of Evidence and the Strength of Guideline Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>A structured approach, based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, was used to grade the quality of the overall evidence and the strength of recommendations for each topic. This grading scheme with two levels for the strength of a recommendation together with four levels of grading for the quality of the evidence, as well as the option of an ungraded statement for general guidance was adopted by the KDIGO Board in December 2008.</p>
<p>The quality of a body of evidence refers to the extent to which the Work Group's confidence in an estimate of effect is sufficient to support a particular recommendation. The process of transparently grading evidence and recommendations for treatment topics is described below in further detail. However, the approach had to be adapted for the main topics of the KDIGO chronic kidney disease (CKD) guideline because they were not treatment-related topics.</p>
<p><strong>Grading the Quality of Evidence for Each Outcome Across Studies</strong></p>
<p>Following the GRADE approach, the quality of a body of evidence pertaining to a particular outcome of interest was initially categorized on the basis of study design (see Table 40 in the original guideline document). For questions of interventions, the initial quality grade was high if the body of evidence consisted of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), low if it consisted of observational studies, and very low if it consisted of studies of other designs. For questions of interventions, the Work Group decided to use only RCTs. The grade for the quality of evidence for each intervention&amp;ndash;outcome pair was then lowered if there were serious limitations to the methodological quality of the aggregate of studies, if there was thought to be a high likelihood of bias, if there were important inconsistencies in the results across studies, if there was uncertainty about the directness of evidence (including limited applicability of the findings to the population of interest), if the data were sparse (for example if there was only one study or if the results include just a few events or observations and were uninformative) or imprecise (for example the confidence interval [CI] spans a range greater than 1 or confidence limits are &amp;lt;0.5 to &amp;gt;2.0). The final grade for the quality of the evidence for an intervention&amp;ndash;outcome pair was then assigned as high, moderate, low, or very low (see Table 40 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>Grading the Overall Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The quality of the overall body of evidence was then determined on the basis of the quality grades for all outcomes of interest, taking into account explicit judgments about the relative importance of each outcome. The resulting four final categories for the quality of overall evidence were A, B, C, and D (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field).</p>

<p><strong>Collaboration Among Participants</strong></p>
<p>The KDIGO Co-Chairs appointed the Work Group Co-Chairs, who then assembled the Work Group of domain experts, including individuals with expertise in internal medicine, adult and pediatric nephrology, diabetology/endocrinology, clinical chemistry, and epidemiology. The Tufts Center for Kidney Disease Guideline Development and Implementation at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, was contracted to conduct a systematic evidence review and provide expertise in guideline development methodology. The ERT consisted of physician&amp;ndash;methodologists with expertise in nephrology, a project coordinator, a research assistant, and a medical writer&amp;ndash;editor. The ERT instructed and advised Work Group members in all steps of literature review, critical literature appraisal, and guideline development. The Work Group and the ERT collaborated closely throughout the project.</p>
<p>The Work Group and its Chairs, KDIGO Co-chairs, ERT, and KDIGO support staff met for three 2-day meetings for training in the guideline development process, topic discussion, and consensus development.</p>
<p>Throughout the project, the ERT offered suggestions for guideline development and led discussions on systematic review, literature searches, data extraction, assessment of quality and applicability of articles, evidence synthesis, grading of evidence and guideline recommendations, and consensus development. The Work Group took the primary role of writing the recommendation statements and rationales and retained final responsibility for their content.</p>
<p><strong>Defining Scope and Topics</strong></p>
<p>This KDIGO CKD guideline was set out to update the KDOQI Clinical Practice Guidelines for CKD: Evaluation, Classification, and Stratification in 2002, which spans many topics related to the diagnosis, classification, stratification, and management of CKD.</p>
<p>The Work Group Co-Chairs prepared the first draft of the scope of work document as a series of open-ended questions to be considered by Work Group members. At their first 2-day meeting, members added further questions until the initial working document included all topics of interest to the Work Group. The inclusive, combined set of questions formed the basis for the deliberation and discussion that followed. The Work Group strove to ensure that all topics deemed clinically relevant and worthy of review were identified and addressed.</p>
<p>Updating the topics of definitions and classification was based on the output from the KDIGO Controversies Conference and the CKD Prognosis Consortium.</p>
<p>Additional topics that relate to explicit selection of diagnostic tests or interventions were chosen to undergo systematic review of the best available evidence. Systematic evidence review entails <em>a priori</em> question formulation, specification of important outcomes for the review, systematic searches, data extraction, tabulation, analysis, and synthesis of evidence and is described in detail for each of the specific questions.</p>
<p>The eight topics for which the ERT conducted searches and evidence review are shown in Table 37 of the original guideline document. For the systematic review topics, the Work Group and ERT further developed and refined each topic and specified screening criteria, literature search strategies, and data extraction forms.</p>
<p>Many other topics were not suitable to be addressed by in-depth evidence review. When the anticipated outcome of an extensive literature search was unlikely to yield evidence that directly informs practice choices, the approach chosen was that of a narrative review.</p>
<p>The Work Group took on the primary role of writing the recommendations and rationale statements and retained final responsibility for the content of the guideline statements and the accompanying narrative. The ERT reviewed draft recommendations and grades for consistency with the conclusions of the evidence review.</p>
<p><strong>Formulating Questions of Interest</strong></p>
<p>Questions of interest were formulated according to the PICODD (Population, Intervention or Predictor, Comparator, Outcome, study Design, and Duration of follow-up) criteria. Details of the PICODD criteria are presented in Table 37 of the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Grading the Quality of Evidence and the Strength of Guideline Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>A structured approach, based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, was used to grade the quality of the overall evidence and the strength of recommendations for each topic. This grading scheme&amp;mdash;with two levels for the strength of a recommendation together with four levels of grading for the quality of the evidence, as well as the option of an ungraded statement for general guidance&amp;mdash;was adopted by the KDIGO Board in December 2008.</p>
<p>The strength of a recommendation indicates the extent to which one can be confident that adherence to the recommendation will do more good than harm. The process of transparently grading evidence and recommendations for treatment topics is described below in further detail. However, the approach had to be adapted for the main topics of the KDIGO chronic kidney disease (CKD) guideline because they were not treatment-related topics.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Review Process</strong></p>
<p>As with all Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines a two step process was used. This included a review by the Board of Directors, with feedback to the Work Group Chairs followed by revisions to the document. The public review, consisting of interested stakeholders from international communities, organizations and individuals, was then undertaken. The draft document was sent to a total of 2,320 external reviewers, with 293 responses received and tabulated. The feedback was carefully reviewed and where appropriate, suggested changes were incorporated into the final document. In the interest of transparency, the Work Group prepared individual responses to each reviewer comment and these will be posted on the KDIGO website.</p></div>"/>

<p>Although the literature searches were intended to be comprehensive, they were not exhaustive. MEDLINE was the only database searched. Hand searches of journals were not performed, and review articles and textbook chapters were not systematically searched. However, important studies known to domain experts that were missed by the electronic literature searches were added to the retrieved articles and reviewed by the Work Group.</p>
<p><strong>Use of the Clinical Practice Guideline</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>This Clinical Practice Guideline document is based upon systematic literature searches last conducted in June 2011, supplemented with additional evidence through November 2012. It is designed to provide information and assist decision making. It is not intended to define a standard of care, and should not be construed as one, nor should it be interpreted as prescribing an exclusive course of management. Variations in practice will inevitably and appropriately occur when clinicians take into account the needs of individual patients, available resources, and limitations unique to an institution or type of practice. Every health-care professional making use of these recommendations is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of applying them in any particular clinical situation. The recommendations for research contained within this document are general and do not imply a specific protocol. </li>
    <li>The guideline will provide a blueprint for an approach to chronic kidney disease (CKD) care in an international context. While the guideline will be sensitive to issues related to ethnicity and also geographical considerations, it is expected that subsequent regional adaptation will be required for specific healthcare settings or contexts. </li>
    <li>This document is not intended to provide enough detail to replace training and education in nephrology, nor is it intended to serve as a textbook of medicine or nephrology. </li>
