	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The levels of recommendation (<strong>1-3</strong>) and the data quality classifications (<strong>I-IV</strong>) are defined at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Ocular Only Versus Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (MG)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Ocular MG</strong></p>
<p>Nurses should monitor the results of the ice pack test with consideration for its limited value in the diagnosis of MG (<strong>Level 2</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Diagnostic Tests</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Laboratory Tests</strong></p>
<p>Nurses should know the adverse events associated with diagnostic testing in MG and how to manage those side effects as needed. Nurses should monitor for results and adverse events associated with the use of edrophonium for diagnostic testing in MG and manage adverse events appropriately (<strong>Level 2</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Electrodiagnostic Testing</strong></p>
<p>Nurses should be familiar with electrodiagnostic testing in MG. Nurses should prepare patients for their experience, including the likelihood of some discomfort (<strong>Level 2</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Other</strong></p>
<p>Nurses should understand and explain the &quot;ice pack test&quot; and diagnostic imaging to the patient and family to lessen fear and anxiety and elicit cooperation and participation (<strong>Level 2</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Nursing Assessment of the Patient with MG</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Assessment Techniques</strong></p>
<p>Nurses should perform a comprehensive nursing assessment of the patient with MG that includes a detailed medical history and symptom description. Nurses should test all voluntary muscles for both muscle strength and fatigability to determine the severity of specific muscle weakness, the degree of functional impairment, and potential complications (see Table 4 in original guideline document) (<strong>Level 3</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Respiratory Muscles</strong></p>
<p>Nurses should perform a detailed physical assessment of respiratory status (<strong>Level 3</strong>).</p>
<p>Nurses should assess the respiratory system appropriately and support respirations as needed until additional interventions are available (<strong>Level 3</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Treatment</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Pharmacological Management</strong></p>
<p>Nurses must administer and teach the patient with MG and their family to administer the correct dose of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors on time (<strong>Level 2</strong>). Nurses must also teach the patient and their family the signs and symptoms of overdose and adverse events (<strong>Level 2</strong>).</p>
<p>Nurses should advise patients who are taking corticosteroids to be aware of infection risk, practice good hand hygiene practices, and avoid exposure to people with infection (<strong>Level 2</strong>).</p>
<p>Nurses should monitor for side effects associated with immunosuppressants and minimize patient risk for infection by maintaining appropriate infection-control practices, including good hand hygiene and sterile technique for invasive procedures (<strong>Level 2</strong>). Nurses should administer antimicrobials as prescribed (<strong>Level 2</strong>).</p>
<p>Nurses should monitor for signs and symptoms of adverse effects associated with all medications used in the management of MG as previously described, including those most commonly associated with long-term immunosuppressants/ immunomodulating agents, specifically, infection, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, bone marrow suppression, and skin cancer (<strong>Level 3</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Other Therapies</strong></p>
<p><em>Plasmapheresis (Therapeutic Plasma Exchange [TPE])</em></p>
<p>Nurses should monitor for improvement following plasmapheresis (<strong>Level 2</strong>).</p>
<p>Nurses should monitor for complications associated with venous access (<strong>Level 2</strong>).</p>
<p>Nurses should monitor for side effects associated with plasmapheresis including fatigue and hypotension (<strong>Level 2</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Intravenous Immunoglobulin G (IVIG) Infusions</em></p>
<p>Nurses must understand the rationale for the use of IVIG in the management of MG and its reported benefits and limitations (<strong>Level 2</strong>). Nurses must be knowledgeable of different brands of IVIG and institution-specific protocols regarding dosage and rates, which may include a test dose and then a gradual increase in rate as tolerated to lessen risk for adverse effects. Action plans for adverse effects must be followed (<strong>Level 2</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Thymectomy</em></p>
<p>In collaboration with the multidisciplinary team, nurses should educate the patient and family regarding indications, pre- and postoperative care, and prognosis for patients undergoing thymectomy (<strong>Level 3</strong>). Following thymectomy, nurses should monitor the patient closely for complications related to MG and the thymectomy procedure and manage them effectively (<strong>Level 3</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Postoperative Care After Thymectomy</em></p>
<p>Nurses should monitor respiratory status, including rate, depth, work of breathing, breath sounds, oxygenation, and ventilation tolerance. Spontaneous breathing trials, pulmonary function studies, forced vital capacity (FVC), and negative inspiratory force (NIF) should be ordered as available (<strong>Level 3</strong>).</p>
<p>Nurses must administer MG medications postoperatively as prescribed. Nurses should balance the administration of medications that may worsen MG, including opioids, with a comfort level that will allow the patient to breathe with the least amount of effort and discomfort (<strong>Level 3</strong>).</p>
<p>Nurses should follow the manufacturer's direction for the chest tube drainage system and monitor chest tube(s) for patency, underwater seal, evidence of air leak, drainage output, and signs and symptoms of infection. Nurses should monitor for signs and symptoms of increasing pneumothorax or hemothorax (<strong>Level 3</strong>).</p>
<p>Nurses should be aware of patients who have factors that may increase the likelihood of a postoperative MG crisis that could complicate their recovery (<strong>Level 3</strong>).</p>
<p>Nurses should monitor closely for signs and symptoms of infection and minimize a patient's risk for infection by consistently complying with infection-control measures (<strong>Level 3</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>MG Crisis</span></strong></p>
<p>Nurses should be knowledgeable in the differentiation of the two different types of MG crises, myasthenic crisis or cholinergic crisis, and should recognize that both are care priorities. In either situation, nurses should perform a complete respiratory and neuromuscular assessment, which is essential to identify ineffective respiratory function and impaired gag and swallow, and initiate the appropriate airway-management strategies and oxygen delivery (<strong>Level 3</strong>) (Vassar et al., 2008).</p>
<p>Nurses should assess respiratory status, including pulmonary function tests (i.e., NIF and FVC); provide pulmonary hygiene as needed; and alert the licensed independent provider regarding indications for additional respiratory therapy management to minimize respiratory complications, including prolonged ventilation and pneumonia (<strong>Level 3</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>General Nursing Management of the Patient With MG</span></strong></p>
<p>Nurses should administer drugs that may worsen MG with caution. Review medication profiles with the pharmacist and licensed independent provider (<strong>Level 3</strong>).</p>
<p>Nurses should adopt the previous protocols to facilitate swallowing, avoid aspirations, and optimize nutritional and fluid status (<strong>Level 3</strong>).</p>
<p>Nurses should apply the above strategies in managing fatigue for the patient with MG (<strong>Level 3</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Special Consideration in the Juvenile MG Population</span></strong></p>
<p>Nurses should be aware of the teratogenic effects of immunosuppressive medications on the fetus and provide appropriate education to women with MG of childbearing age (<strong>Level 3</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Psychosocial and Educational Needs</span></strong></p>
<p>Nurses should educate the patient with MG and their family regarding management of the disease; influence of the disease on lifestyle, swallowing, and chewing impairment; and fatigue and energy conservation (<strong>Level 3</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Data Quality Classification</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: Randomized controlled trial (RCT) without significant limitations or meta-analysis</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: RCT with important limitations (e.g., methodological flaws or inconsistent results) and observational studies (e.g., cohort or case-control)</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: Qualitative study, case study, or series</p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong>: Evidence from expert committee reports and/or expert opinion of the guideline panel, standards of care, and clinical protocols</p>
<p><strong>Levels of Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level 1</strong>: Recommendations are supported by class I evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level 2</strong>: Recommendations are supported by class II evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level 3</strong>: Recommendations are supported by class III and IV evidence.</p></div>"/>
