	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform a systematic literature review on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an assessment report. The Evidence Review Group (ERG) report for this technology appraisal was prepared by School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR), University of Sheffield (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Clinical Effectiveness</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Systematic Reviews for Clinical Efficacy</strong></p>
<p>Two systematic reviews were performed for the assessment of clinical effectiveness in the manufacturer's submission (MS). The objective of the first systematic review was to identify all relevant clinical information available for the treatment and prevention of acute manic and mixed episodes in bipolar disorder in children and adolescents with aripiprazole. The review was based on the search and inclusion strategy of a previous systematic review (commissioned by NICE in 2005) which did not identify any relevant randomised controlled trial (RCT) or non-RCT evidence for aripiprazole in children and adolescents with bipolar I disorder.</p>
<p>The second systematic review was designed with the objective of identifying all relevant clinical information available for the treatment and prevention of acute manic and mixed episodes in bipolar disorder in children and adolescents with the following comparators:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Risperidone </li>
    <li>Quetiapine </li>
    <li>Olanzapine </li>
    <li>Combination of any of the above with lithium or valproate </li>
</ul>
<p>This review was also based on the same search and inclusion strategy as the NICE 2005 review, and identified three randomised controlled trials that examined the use of antipsychotics in the treatment of mania in children and adolescents. However, only the results from one trial were included in this update.</p>
<p>Of the two other excluded studies, one was an open label trial including some bipolar II patients, and one was a semi-RCT which also included bipolar II patients. For the long term management of children and adolescents with bipolar disorder, the only study identified by the previous systematic review was excluded not only because it examined lithium, but also because it included a mixture of bipolar I and II patients.</p>
<p>It was not clear from the MS why the searches for both reviews were limited up to January 2012 which makes the evidence generated from their searches one year out of date and therefore clarification was requested from the manufacturers. The manufacturers did update the searches on February 4th 2013 in response to the clarification questions raised by the ERG. The manufacturers stated that rather than repeating their searches a non-systematic approach was used to find further studies since January 2012 due to time constraints. Only PubMed, Google Scholar and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched by the manufacturers but EMBASE and Cochrane Library were not searched. Four RCTs and three non-RCTs were identified.</p>
<p>The ERG repeated and updated the searches until January 2013 using the systematic approach in the MS. Database searches were repeated and updated by using strategies provided in the MS.</p>
<p>The searches for RCT evidence regarding the intervention (aripiprazole) and the comparators (risperidone, quetiapine, olanzapine, or in combination with lithium or valproate) were considered comprehensive. However in the searches for non-RCT evidence, the use of the heading &quot;Epidemiologic study characteristics&quot; in the RCT search filter was too restrictive and not adequate to capture non-RCT evidence in this search strategy. This search strategy for non-RCT evidence was not clearly justified in the MS or clarification response from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Justification for the omission of adverse events searches were not provided in the MS or explained in the clarification response. As a result, the ERG carried out supplementary searches in MEDLINE and EMBASE for adverse event using previously published methods. Further details of the supplementary searches are provided in Appendix 1 of the ERG report.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>The inclusion and exclusion criteria used in the selection of evidence for the systematic review of clinical effectiveness were presented in the MS. The MS reports that each review was performed independently by 2 reviewers, who then came to a consensus on the results.</p>
<p><em>Inclusion Criteria</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Patients with manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder </li>
    <li>Patients aged &amp;lt;18 years </li>
    <li>At least 1 of the interventions studied must be aripiprazole </li>
    <li>Studies must provide sufficient detail regarding methods and results to enable the methodological quality of the study </li>
    <li>RCT </li>
    <li>Non-RCT that still evaluates the effectiveness of interventions (acceptable study designs: prospective cohort study, retrospective chart/database review) </li>
    <li>English language </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Exclusion Criteria</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Cross-sectional or retrospective studies </li>
</ul>
<p>The inclusion criteria for the review appeared reasonable and relevant to the decision problem. See Table 4 in the ERG report for detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria for the main study and the additional RCT.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Economic Evaluation</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>ERG Comment on Manufacturer's Review of Cost-Effectiveness Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer did not identify any relevant economic evaluations. The manufacturer's search strategy was based on a previously published systematic review in order to identify all relevant cost-effectiveness information available for the treatment of acute manic and mixed episodes in bipolar I disorder in children and adolescents.</p>
<p>The MS reports that 6,694 records were found. As with the systematic review for clinical efficacy, searches were limited to January 2012. The ERG was able to repeat and update the database searches until January 2013. A total of 7,056 records were retrieved, of which 955 were in 2012 which represents a significant number of records that were missed by the manufacturers searches that were conducted up to January 2012. Whilst the quality of life terms were comprehensive, the cost filter was somewhat restrictive, and the ERG recommends the use of a sensitive filter such as Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN). The ERG does not believe that any additional relevant studies were missed by the manufacturer's cost-effectiveness review.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform a systematic literature review on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an assessment report. The Evidence Review Group (ERG) report for this technology appraisal was prepared by School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR), University of Sheffield (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Clinical Effectiveness</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Describe and Critique the Manufacturer's Approach to Validity Assessment</strong></p>
<p>Trials NCT00110461 and NCT00116259 employ the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) as the primary outcome measure. The manufacturer's submission (MS) states that the YMRS scale is widely accepted and commonly used for measuring manic symptoms in clinical trials with children and adolescents with juvenile bipolar disorder. The clinical advisors to the ERG have stated that the use of the YMRS is appropriate for evaluating efficacy of antipsychotic medication. The ERG is satisfied that the outcome measures investigated in the MS ensure that the included studies and assessment undertaken by the manufacturers is internally valid.</p>
<p>Quality assessment was undertaken by the manufacturer using the suggested format in the NICE specification for manufacturer/sponsor submission of evidence template in summary form for both trials and in fuller detail for trial NCT0011046121. The quality assessment for trial NCT0011046121 is presented in Table 8 of the ERG report.</p>
<p><strong>Statistical Analyses</strong></p>
<p>The statistical analysis for trial NCT00110461 for the primary endpoint is described as an overall F-test for mean change from baseline in YMRS total score at a significance level of 0.05 (two-tailed) for the aripiprazole 10 mg, aripiprazole 30 mg and placebo groups. The differences between groups (aripiprazole 10 mg versus placebo and aripiprazole 30 mg versus placebo) were investigated using a two-tailed test at 5% significance.</p>
<p>Changes in scores from baseline were analysed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment as a factor and baseline score as a covariate at each time point. Least squares (LS) means were used for the treatment comparisons. Two-tailed Student t-tests were used to test differences between the LS means within the ANCOVA model. The proportion of responders was analysed using chi-squared tests. The proportion of patients with clinically significant weight gain (&amp;ge;7% increase from baseline) was tested using the Fisher exact test.</p>
<p><strong>Meta-Analysis: Aripiprazole Versus Placebo</strong></p>
<p>A meta-analysis of NCT00110461 (pooled 10 to 30 mg dose) and NCT00116259 (20 mg dose aripiprazole) was performed. Results were not provided as forest plots for the meta-analysis. The manufacturers concluded from their analysis that:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The meta-analysis found aripiprazole to still be statistically significantly superior to placebo in inducing symptomatic response (as measured by &amp;gt;50% change in YMRS score) at weeks 1, 2 and 4, but not at week 3. </li>
    <li>The meta-analysis found aripiprazole to be associated with a statistically significant higher rate of extrapyramidal symptoms than placebo, but not of somnolence. </li>
    <li>However, the small size of study NCT00116259 and the different patient population from the pivotal aripiprazole study (includes bipolar II disorders and restricted to patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]) means that the results are of limited use. </li>

<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Economic Evaluation</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Summary and Critique of Manufacturer's Submitted Economic Evaluation by the ERG</strong></p>
<p><em>NICE Reference Case Checklist</em></p>
<p>See Table 50 of the ERG report for information regarding consistency of the manufacturer's economic evaluation with the NICE reference case checklist.</p>
<p><em>Model Structure</em></p>
<p>The manufacturer provided a <em>de novo</em> model-based economic evaluation constructed in Microsoft Excel and based upon a cohort Markov model. In addition to an absorbing death state, the manufacturers modelled 22 different health states, divided into four distinct groups. Three of these groups related to antipsychotic treatment lines (first-, second- and third-line) and were identical in structure: each contained an acute phase (consisting of three separate health states based on elapsed time), a sub-acute phase, and a maintenance phase (consisting of two separate health states based on whether or not the patient was assumed to be on treatment). The fourth group consisted of four separate health states which modelled therapy resistance for patients who had not responded to the three lines of antipsychotic treatment.</p>
<p>A schematic of the model is shown in Figure 2 of the ERG report. The modelling of adverse events was included within the treatment-related health states. Patients were modelled as receiving in-hospital treatment for all of the health states within the acute and sub-acute phases, as well as the &quot;Therapy Resistance Hospitalised&quot; state. Patients could die at any point in the model.</p>
<p>All patients enter the model at the start of the first treatment line (in the health state &quot;Acute 1st line Week 1&quot;). Patients move through the treatment lines if either they discontinue drug use before response (i.e., during the acute phase) or if they relapse before discharge from hospital (i.e., during the sub-acute phase). If patients relapse within the maintenance phase they remain on the same treatment line to which they responded. The &quot;Therapy Resistance Phase&quot; is essentially the fourth and final treatment line, where treatment is assumed to be lithium. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) are accrued as time spent in each health state, with different utility values for the acute, sub-acute and maintenance phases (the lowest utility values are for the acute phase and the highest are for the maintenance phase). The main driver of costs is time spent as an inpatient (in either the acute or sub-acute phases). Treatment effectiveness was reflected by the time spent within each model phase (acute, sub-acute or maintenance).</p>
<p>The Markov model used a cycle length of one week, to reflect the timing of assessments in the pivotal trial for aripiprazole. The ERG believes that weekly Markov cycles are appropriate because the first three weeks of acute treatment are the main drivers of cost-effectiveness results. The option for half-cycle correction was included in the model but was not used in the base case results presented in the MS. Including a half-cycle correction slightly reduces the total costs and total QALYs for each strategy, but does not alter the conclusions of the economic evaluation.</p>
<p>See Section 5 in the ERG report for more information on the cost-effectiveness analysis.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Considerations</strong></p>
<p>Technology appraisal recommendations are based on a review of clinical and economic evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Appraisal Process</strong></p>
<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invites &quot;consultee&quot; and &quot;commentator&quot; organisations to take part in the appraisal process. Consultee organisations include national groups representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review. Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to comment on the appraisal documents.</p>
<p>Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service (NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not asked to submit evidence themselves.</p>
<p>NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review published evidence on the technology and prepare an &quot;assessment report&quot;. Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a document called the evaluation report.</p>
<p>An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the &quot;appraisal consultation document&quot; (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE Web site. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.</p>
<p>When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document called the &quot;final appraisal determination&quot; (FAD). This is submitted to NICE for approval.</p>
<p>Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is on the Appraisal Committee?</strong></p>
<p>NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an independent committee. This includes health professionals working in the NHS and people who are familiar with the issues affecting patients and carers. Although the Appraisal Committee seeks the views of organisations representing health professionals, patients, carers, manufacturers and government, its advice is independent of any vested interests.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Summary of Appraisal Committee's Key Conclusions on Cost-Effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Availability and Nature of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The Committee considered the manufacturer's economic model and the Evidence Review Group's (ERG's) critique and exploratory analysis. It noted that the ERG considered the manufacturer's model to be transparent, robust, and well structured. The Committee agreed that the model structure was appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Uncertainties Around and Plausibility of Assumptions and Inputs in the Economic Model</strong></p>
<p>The Committee was aware that the manufacturer's probabilistic sensitivity analyses suggested that there was uncertainty surrounding the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and it understood that this may be a result of the lack of statistically significant differences in response rates obtained from the network meta-analysis for the&amp;nbsp;four antipsychotics.</p>
<p><strong>Incorporation of Health-Related Quality-of-Life Benefits and Utility Values/Have Any Potential Significant and Substantial Health-Related Benefits Been Identified That Were Not Included in the Economic Model, and How Have They Been Considered?</strong></p>
<p>Not applicable as the Committee had no concerns about the health-related quality-of-life data used in the manufacturer's economic model.</p>
<p><strong>Are There Specific Groups of People for Whom the Technology Is Particularly Cost-Effective?</strong></p>
<p>Not applicable to this appraisal.</p>
<p><strong>What Are the Key Drivers of Cost-Effectiveness?</strong></p>
<p>The Committee was aware that the main parameters that influenced the results were the rates of response applied during the treatment phase. The Committee noted that a higher response rate during the treatment phase resulted in people leaving hospital earlier, which had both cost and health-related quality-of-life benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Most Likely Cost-Effectiveness Estimate (Given as an ICER)</strong></p>
<p>The Committee noted that the pathway in which aripiprazole was positioned second dominated all of the other strategies. The Committee also noted that the ranges of costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (in the base case, costs ranged from &amp;pound;74,133 to &amp;pound;75,066, and QALYs ranged from 2.516 to 2.525) across the strategies were similar. Results from the sensitivity analyses demonstrated that each of the strategies was dominated by every other strategy in at least some of the probabilistic iterations.</p></div>"/>
