<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Protection and Risk Factors for Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Lack of Hygiene as a Risk Factor for UTI: Using a Nappy and Oxyuriasis</strong></p>
<p><em>Key Questions</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Does a lack of hygiene when using a nappy affect the incidence of UTI? </li>
    <li>Does a lack of hygiene related to the presence of oxyuriasis affect the incidence of UTI? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - It is recommended to change nappies frequently.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - It is recommended to rule out pinworm infection in girls with recurrent UTI.</p>
<p><strong>Breastfeeding and Its Protective Role against UTI</strong></p>
<p><em>Key Question</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Does breastfeeding give any protection against UTI? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C</strong> - It is recommended to inform mothers of the benefits and the protective effect of breastfeeding when planning the feeding of their infants.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - It is recommended to continue breastfeeding for at least 6 months.</p>
<p><strong>Phimosis as a Risk Factor for UTI</strong></p>
<p><em>Key Question</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Are uncircumcised boys more likely to have UTI? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B</strong> - It is recommended to explore and assess the foreskin in all boys with UTI, whether associated with structural abnormalities of the urinary tract or not.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - Circumcision should not be routinely performed even though there is an association between circumcision and reduced risk of UTI.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - It is recommended to try obtaining retraction of the foreskin by medical treatment in boys or infants with recurrent febrile urinary tract infection, with or without malformations or dysfunctions of the urinary tract associated with phimosis.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - In those boys or infants with recurrent febrile urinary tract infection, with or without malformations or dysfunctions of the urinary tract associated with phimosis where phimosis persists after medical treatment, it is recommended to perform circumcision.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Diagnosis of UTI</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Key Question</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>What is the validity of the clinical findings for diagnosis of UTI in children? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A</strong> - Clinical suspicion of UTI in children from the clinical manifestations requires laboratory confirmation, due to its low discriminative ability.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong> - In children under 24 months of age with fever without focus it is recommended to take a urine test to rule out UTI.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong> - In children over 24 months old, with symptoms of abdominal or back pain, fever, dysuria, frequency or both, or the onset of incontinence it is recommended to take a urine test to confirm UTI.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Biological Diagnosis of UTI</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Urine Collection Method</strong></p>
<p><em>Key Question</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>What is the method of choice for urine collection for the diagnosis of UTI? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B</strong> - For children who can control urination, a midstream clean catch urine sample is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - For children who cannot control urination that require immediate diagnosis and/or treatment, it is recommended to use a collection technique that minimises the risk of contamination (suprapubic aspiration [SPA] or bladder catheterisation). The choice of technique should be subject to the level of training and resources of the health care centre.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - For children who cannot control urination that do not require immediate diagnosis and/or treatment, use a well performed non-invasive urine collection technique (perineal bag or clean catch).</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - If the analysis of urine collected by a non-sterile technique (perineal bag) is contaminated, it is recommended to confirm it by taking a repeat sample using techniques that minimise the risk of contamination. The choice of technique will depend on the patient's clinical status, level of collection training and healthcare setting resources.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong> - It is recommended to use ultrasound, if available, to improve the effectiveness of suprapubic aspiration, when this is chosen.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - It is recommended that patient care points that offer suprapubic aspiration should have ultrasound.</p>
<p><strong>Preserving and Transporting Urine Samples</strong></p>
<p><em>Key Question</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>How should a urine sample be preserved and transported? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C</strong> - It is recommended to process urine samples within 4 hours so they are not affected by bacterial growth.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - If it is not possible to start the urine culture analysis within 4 hours, it is recommended to refrigerate the urine to be used to detect bacteriuria immediately after collection.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - When refrigeration is not possible and the urine is to be processed between 4 and 24 hours after collection, preservatives may be employed as major delays can lead to bacterial growth.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - It is recommended not to consider the results of some urinary profile parameters (nitrite and glucose) from urine with chemical preservatives added, as they may not be valid.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - When using chemical preservatives, ensure the minimum volume of urine sample recommended by the manufacturer is taken.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnostic Tests in Urine</strong></p>
<p><em>Key Question</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>What is the most valid urine test for diagnosing UTI in children? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B</strong> - It is recommended to perform an urgent Gram-stain microscopic examination of urine and urine culture on infants under 3 months with suspected UTI.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - It is recommended to perform a urine microscopic examination or, failing that, a dipstick test and urine culture on patients with suspected UTI who are younger than 2 years or who cannot control urination. If there is a strong clinical suspicion of UTI or the patient is at risk of severe disease, these tests must be performed urgently.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - For patients younger than 2 years or who cannot control urination, with suspected UTI, it is recommended to start antibiotic treatment after collecting the urine culture sample if they have bacteriuria or positive nitrites in a reliable urine sample (collected by SPA or catheter).</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - For infants at risk of severe disease (with fever of unknown origin) younger than 2 years or who cannot control urination, it is recommended to start antibiotic treatment after collecting the urine culture sample if they have bacteriuria or positive nitrites or leukocyturia in a reliable urine sample (collected by SPA or catheter).</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - In patients older than 2 years with suspected UTI who can control urination, it is recommended to perform a urine dipstick test. Perform a microscopic examination of urine, if available, only in dubious cases.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - In patients older than 2 years with a high clinical suspicion of UTI (specific symptoms with the presence of nitrites or bacteriuria, with or without leukocytes), it is recommended to start empirical antibiotic treatment after collecting the urine culture.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - In patients older than 2 years, with leukocytes only in urine, it is recommended to perform a urine culture, and consider starting antibiotic treatment depending on the likelihood of symptoms and the patient's clinical situation.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Do not treat or perform a urine culture on patients older than 2 years if no leukocytes or nitrites are found in the urine sample and clinical features are non-specific.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - It is recommended to confirm UTI by urine culture when available. It is especially necessary in the following cases:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Children under 2 years or those who cannot control urination </li>
    <li>Where there is suspicion of upper tract UTI </li>
    <li>In any patient at risk of serious illness </li>
    <li>In any patient, when the dipstick results are inconclusive or do not agree with the clinical examination </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Localisation of UTI</strong></p>
<p><em>Key Question</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Is there any clinical finding or laboratory test to locate a suspected or confirmed UTI in children? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - Suspect acute pyelonephritis (APN) in the presence of high fever &amp;ge;38.5&amp;deg;C and/or systemic involvement.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - Suspect APN with high acute phase reactants C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or procalcitonin (PCT), especially the latter.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - Suspect APN with interleukin-6 (IL-6) in urine &amp;gt;15 pg/mL.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - Suspect APN with a defect in renal concentrating ability, i.e., reduced maximum urine osmolality checked by an appropriate diagnostic test.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - If there are no symptoms and/or clinical signs (fever, abdominal pain or malaise) with normal or slight increase in acute phase reactants (CRP &amp;lt;20 mg/L, PCT &amp;lt;0.5 ng/mL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] &amp;lt;10 mm/h and/or IL-6 in serum &amp;lt;4 pg/mL) or normal spontaneous osmolality, do not suspect renal parenchymal involvement.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - Although analytical studies help in locating UTI, they are not routinely necessary for its management and treatment.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Diagnostic Imaging for UTI</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Key Question</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>What is the most effective imaging test for the diagnosis of structural abnormalities of the urinary tract and/or kidney damage in children with UTI? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - It is recommended to perform a urinary tract ultrasound after a first UTI if any of the following criteria apply to the patient:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Febrile UTI </li>
    <li>No control over urination, and with no pre-natal or normal post-natal ultrasound </li>
    <li>Signs of urinary tract dysfunction </li>
    <li>Abdominal or bladder mass </li>
    <li>High creatinine levels </li>
    <li>UTI from a microorganism other than <em>Escherichia coli</em> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C</strong> - It is recommended to perform an ultrasound of the urinary tract in all children with recurrent UTI.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - It is recommended to use techniques enhancing the ultrasound of the urinary tract, if available.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Do not perform routine renal scintigraphy with technetium-labelled dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-m) (DMSA) in the acute phase for patients with UTI.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - Consider selective use of DMSA in the acute phase, if available, if the result is important for the subsequent diagnosis of the patient (e.g., to decide treatment or complementary tests).</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - It is recommended to perform delayed DMSA scintigraphy (after 6 months) after a first febrile UTI if any of the following criteria apply to the patient:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Atypical evolution (persistence of fever &amp;gt;48 hours) </li>
    <li>Signs of lower urinary tract dysfunction </li>
    <li>Abdominal or bladder mass </li>
    <li>High creatinine levels </li>
    <li>Septicaemia </li>
    <li>UTI from a microorganism other than <em>E. coli</em> </li>
    <li>Pathological findings in previous imaging studies (e.g., ultrasound, cystogram, DMSA) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - Consider delayed DMSA scintigraphy (after 6 months) after a first febrile UTI if clinical, laboratory or radiological findings indicate a high likelihood of renal involvement.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - It is recommended to perform DMSA scintigraphy on paediatric patients with recurrent febrile UTI.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - In general, it is not recommended to perform cystography (voiding cystourethrogram [VCUG], radionuclide cystography or echo-enhanced cystography) on children after a first UTI, unless any of the following criteria apply to the patient:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Recurrent UTI </li>
    <li>Abnormalities in previous imaging studies (ultrasound or DMSA) </li>
    <li>Signs of lower urinary tract dysfunction </li>
    <li>Family history of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) </li>

<p><strong>Choice of Antibiotic and Chemoprophylactic Dose</strong></p>
<p><em>Key Question</em></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>When antibiotic prophylaxis is deemed necessary, what antibiotics and doses should be recommended? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - It is recommended to take into account local resistance patterns when proposing prophylactic treatment, and try to select antibiotics with a narrower spectrum of action to prevent the upper airway bacteria from developing resistance to them.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - Taking into account the above recommendation, it is recommended to use TMP or TMP-SMX in patients older than 2 months of age, and nitrofurantoin in patients older than 2 to 3 years, as the use of prophylactic antibiotics or antiseptics cannot be prioritised due to the lack of available evidence.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - In children under 2 months of age, or in any situation where nitrofurantoin or TMP or TMP-SMX cannot be used, it is recommended to use as prophylactic antibiotic amoxicillin or 1st or 2nd generation cephalosporins.</p>

<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*Sometimes the development group wishes to highlight an important practical aspect for which there is probably no supporting evidence. In general, these cases are related to an aspect of treatment generally accepted to be good clinical practice, and is evaluated as a point of good clinical practice. These messages are not an alternative to the recommendations based on evidence, but should be considered only when there is no other way of highlighting that aspect.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Clinical questions were prepared and selected at successive meetings by brainstorming and subsequent prioritisation by the Guideline Development Group (GDG), concluding with the questions contained in the original guideline document related to epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, monitoring urinary tract infection (UTI) in children and catheter care in children. The clinical questions were prepared using the PICO format (Patient/Intervention/Comparison/Outcome).</p>
<p>After the questions were prepared, a literature search of databases and other specialist sources (Medline, EMBASE, Clinical Excellence, Trip Database, Gu&amp;iacute;aSalud, National Guideline Clearinghouse, Guidelines International Network [GIN]) was begun to find other national or international clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) on a similar theme. This resulted in 12 guides being found, of which 5 were discarded, as the people, topics, interventions, date of issue or methodology did not meet the objectives and scope of this CPG. The 7 remaining guidelines were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines Research &amp;amp; Evaluation (AGREE) instrument by 4 independent reviewers.</p>
<p>The individual scores for these guides are available in Annex 1 (Table 13 in the original guideline document). It was agreed that only those guidelines that obtained scores above 85% for rigour of preparation would be considered suitable as a source of evidence in this guide. There were 5 eligible, of which 3 focused exclusively on care of the catheterised patient and catheter care.</p>
<p>These 5 guides became secondary sources of evidence for answering different clinical questions, and this is indicated in the different sections of the original guideline document where findings or studies from them are referenced. The methodology proposed by Servicio de Evaluac&amp;iacute;on de Tecnolog&amp;iacute;as Sanitar&amp;iacute;as (OSTEBA) in the Asthma CPG Methodology Description Evaluation report was followed to modify and update the evidence from these guidelines.</p>
<p>For clinical questions addressed in the original guideline document which were included in the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) CPG, the searches from 2006 were updated to June 2010 by modifying those used by NICE. For the rest of the questions, new specific search strategies were developed: limiting them to the previous 10 years, except in exceptional cases where no appropriate studies were found, when they were not limited by date.</p>
<p>The search strategies combined terms in controlled language in each database (Medical Subject Heading [MeSH], Emtree, Decs) and free terms to improve and balance their sensitivity and specificity. The sources were Medline (PubMed), EMBASE (Elsevier.com), CRD Databases, Cochrane Library, Information Behavior in Everyday Contexts (IBEC) and Literatura Latino Americana em Ci&amp;ecirc;ncias da Sa&amp;uacute;de (LILAC). For the questions relating to catheters included in Chapter 18 of the original guideline document, the Cumulative Index to Nursing &amp;amp; Allied Health (CINAHL) database was also consulted. For questions regarding treatment, the clinical trials registry ClinicalTrials.gov was used.</p>
<p>Searches were tailored to the types of studies best suited to the question in Spanish, French, English and Portuguese.</p>
<p>An inverse search was made in those referenced articles, included and excluded, which were identified. No systematic search was made of grey literature, although in some cases congress summaries were included in the volume of evidence due to its relevance, and given the absence of other studies.</p>
<p>The detailed information with the methodological process of the CPG (search strategies for each clinical question, critical reading sheets for the selected studies, tables summarising the evidence and formal evaluation) are available at <a href=&quot;http://www.guiasalud.es&quot; title=&quot;Guia Salud Web site&quot;>www.guiasalud.es</a> (see also the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p></div>"/>

<p>The steps followed for the preparation of this guide started with the constitution of the guideline development group (GDG), composed of 15 clinical professionals from different health care settings, primary care and hospital care, as well as various specialties: nursing, paediatrics, paediatric surgery and paediatric nephrology. The GDG did not include patients or relatives, and it requested 3 potential users of information for patients (parents of young children) to review its contents.</p>
<p>After critical appraisal of the evidence, recommendations were made according to formal assessment or reasoned judgment. In addition to the volume and quality of evidence, the GDG had to consider the applicability of the results, their consistency and their relevance in the National Health System or their clinical impact. For those clinical questions where the evidence was scarce, of low methodological quality (levels of evidence 1- and 2-) or inconsistent, recommendations were established based on group consensus.</p></div>"/>

In general, these cases are related to an aspect of treatment generally accepted to be good clinical practice, and is evaluated as a point of good clinical practice. These messages are not an alternative to the recommendations based on evidence, but should be considered only when there is no other way of highlighting that aspect.</p>

    <li>When assessing the adequacy of a urine collection technique, both its diagnostic validity and the cost of any diagnostic errors incurred must be considered. Undiagnosed urinary tract infection (UTI) will result in a therapeutic delay and a possible increased risk of kidney damage; whereas, UTI misdiagnosed due to urine contamination can initiate a series of inappropriate diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. </li>
    <li>Cystography involves inserting a catheter into the bladder and injecting a substance that acts as a contrast. The risks of the test are associated with the catheter, its inconvenience and the radiation involved if done by radiology or isotope. </li>
    <li>Intravenous urography involves injecting a contrast containing iodine through a vein to obtain a photographic image and anatomical details of the kidney and urinary tract. There are radiation hazards and the possibility of an allergic reaction to the injected contrast dye. </li>
    <li>Treatment with antibiotics poses risks to the patient, such as allergic reactions to medications, gastrointestinal and other side effects, and increased bacterial resistance. </li>
    <li>The urinary catheter is a procedure performed frequently and is usually safe, however, there are special risks in children, which are greater still in younger children. The use of suitable catheters, an understanding of the lower urinary tract anatomy and knowledge of how far to insert a urinary catheter are essential to reduce complications associated with their use. Reported complications with catheter use include patient discomfort, urethral trauma, and catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI). </li>
