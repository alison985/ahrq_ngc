<p><strong>Clinical Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>For individuals at elevated risk of developing dental caries, the panel made clinical recommendations for the use of specific topical fluoride agents (as shown in the table below); these recommendations are based on the evidence statements and the balance of benefits with potential harm. The panel recommends topical fluoride agents only for people at elevated risk for dental caries. Further details of the strength of the clinical recommendations for each form of topical fluoride and age group are available in Appendix 1 of the original guideline document.</p>
<p>The panel recommends the following for people at risk of developing dental caries: 2.26% fluoride varnish or 1.23% fluoride (acidulated phosphate fluoride [APF]) gel, or a prescription-strength, home-use 0.5% fluoride gel or paste or 0.09% fluoride mouthrinse for patients 6 years or older. Only 2.26% fluoride varnish is recommended for children younger than 6 years. The strengths of the recommendations for the recommended products varied from &quot;in favor&quot; to &quot;expert opinion for&quot;.</p>
<p>The panel judged that the benefits outweighed the potential for harm for all professionally applied and prescription-strength, home-use topical fluoride agents and age groups except for children younger than 6 years. In these children, the risk of experiencing adverse events (particularly nausea and vomiting) associated with swallowing professionally applied topical fluoride agents outweighed the potential benefits of using all of the topical fluoride agents except for 2.26 percent fluoride varnish.</p>

<p>Two authors used the strategy as presented in Appendix 2 in the original guideline document to search MEDLINE through PubMed and the Cochrane Library. In addition, two authors hand-searched references of relevant recent systematic reviews and other selected articles in order to include studies that might have been missed through the electronic sources.</p>
<p>Figure 1 in the original guideline document shows the process and results of the literature screening process. MEDLINE (through PubMed) was searched from 1965 through March 4, 2011 resulting in 5,009 articles. An additional search of MEDLINE (through PubMed) to identify articles on prescription-strength toothpaste was conducted on October 5, 2011 for articles published since 1965 inclusive, which identified 23 articles. A second electronic database (The Cochrane Library) was also searched from 1965 through March 4, 2011 resulting 1,281 articles. The electronic database searches were all updated on August 30, 2012 resulting in 260 unique hits, for a total of 6,547 articles found. Through a hand-searching process, another 47 articles were identified for consideration.</p>
<p>Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts using the inclusion and exclusion criteria as shown below and selected 402 articles for full-text review. One author reviewed the manuscripts in full and identified articles for exclusion as reported in Appendix 3 of the original guideline document. Two members of the expert panel reviewed the reasons for exclusion and approved the final exclusion list. When a reviewer was uncertain, she referred the papers to the expert panel members for decision. Discrepancies between reviewers were resolved by a third expert panel member and Chair of this workgroup.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Critical Appraisal of Included Studies</span></strong></p>
<p>The grading system used in the original guideline document was adapted from the United States Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) system. The guideline panel assessed the following four key elements in their critical appraisal process: Randomization, allocation concealment, blinding and losses to follow-up. All panel members participated in an orientation through a conference call to standardize the application of the critical appraisal criteria. Each panel member received five to seven studies to review, along with a standardized data abstraction form. Independent from the panel members, one of three authors duplicated the review and critical appraisal of all included studies independently and blinded to the panel's review. This ensured appraisal by two independent and blinded reviewers and standardized application of the criteria by all reviewers. During a three-day face-to-face panel meeting, all panel members reviewed and extensively discussed results from each study.</p>
<p>Each included trial was critically appraised according to the criteria displayed in Table 3 of the original guideline document, which are formatted such that a &quot;yes&quot; response indicates low risk of bias. The number of &quot;yes&quot; answers was counted to provide a risk of bias score. The numerical values of the risk of bias score generally can be interpreted as: 9-11 = low risk of bias; 7-8 = moderate risk of bias; and 0-6 = high risk of bias. Note that studies were assessed based on the methods they reported, sometimes without certain knowledge of the methods actually used.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Data Synthesis and Meta-Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Choice of Outcome Measures</strong></p>
<p>Caries increment was the primary outcome measure, which is the number of newly decayed, missing and/or filled surfaces or teeth experienced by each participant per year compared to baseline. Caries increment is derived from longitudinal and not cross-sectional studies. The panel adapted a set of rules published in a Cochrane review of caries trials to select outcome data from each study for subsequent analysis. Specifically, the panel chose data for &quot;all surface types combined&quot; over data for &quot;specific types (surfaces)&quot; only; data for &quot;all erupted and erupting teeth combined&quot; over data for &quot;erupted&quot; only, and this over data for &quot;erupting only&quot;; data from &quot;clinical and radiological examinations combined&quot; over data from &quot;clinical&quot; only, and this over &quot;radiological&quot; only; decayed, missing or filled surfaces or teeth surfaces (DMFS) scores over decayed, filled surfaces (DFS) or decayed surfaces (DS); net caries increment data over crude (observed) increment data; and follow-up nearest to three years (often the one at the end of the treatment period) over all other lengths of follow-up.</p>
<p>When data on both the tooth surface-level and tooth-level were available, the panel extracted data for both. Similarly, the panel extracted data for &quot;dentinal/cavitated&quot; caries lesions, as well as for &quot;all stages&quot; (these data are presented in Appendix 3 in the original guideline document). The panel also extracted data for primary and permanent teeth separately.</p>
<p><strong>Imputing Variances</strong></p>
<p>When needed and possible, the panel imputed non-reported standard deviations using a linear regression equation.</p>
<p><strong>Adjusting for Cluster-Randomization</strong></p>
<p>Some studies used group randomization (groups such as schools or classes as opposed to individuals receiving the same intervention). In some of these studies, the results were not adequately adjusted for the unit of analysis being the cluster rather than the individual. Standard statistical procedures for adjustment for clustering depend on the number of clusters and the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC). The ICC ranges from 0 to 1, with the smaller number indicating the smaller cluster effect and vice versa; however, it is often not reported, thus requiring estimation.&amp;nbsp;The standardized mean difference (SMD) for three ICC values (0, 0.1, and 0.2) were calculated, and the resulting effects on the SMD are presented, when applicable.</p>
<p><strong>Effect Estimates</strong></p>
<p>Individual study results were combined by meta-analysis when multiple papers using comparable methods were included for the same fluoride agent, with the objective of obtaining a more powerful estimate of the true effect size. The SMD between the treatment and control arms was used as the effect estimate, since it indicates whether the intervention is effective (i.e., works or does not work) and allows measures on a variety of scales to be combined.</p>
<p>Data on cavitated surfaces were used in the meta-analysis calculations when both surface- and tooth-level cavitated data were extracted. When only all stages data were reported, those data were also included in the meta-analysis with cavitated data. When only tooth-level cavitated data were reported, the data were summarized separately.</p>
<p>For individual studies judged to be too clinically heterogeneous to combine into a meta-analysis, SMD between the treatment and control arms in each study was used as the summary estimate. Individual study results (as SMD), if present, are shown in a table along with the meta-analysis results, and not presented graphically in a forest plot. All analyses were designed to assess superiority, not equivalence.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Interpretation Issues</strong></p>
<p>Other systematic reviews on topical fluorides presented prevented fraction (PF), number needed to treat (NNT), and SMD as their effect estimates. The panel chose a pragmatic approach to summarize and interpret the data, which was to summarize one effect estimate (SMD), and then provide conversions of that estimate into both PF and NNT for those more familiar with these effect estimates. The methods are described in Appendix 5 in the original guideline document, and the results are presented in each topical fluoride section. The methods originate from the observation that the character of DMFS data (that mean caries increments are similar to their standard deviations) implies that meta-analysis of SMD (the difference between two means divided by an estimate of the within-group standard deviation) is similar in magnitude to PF (the difference in mean caries increments between the treatment and control groups divided by the mean increment of the control group). The panel notes that the regression equation used to convert SMD to PF in Appendix 5 in the original guideline document was derived from studies on topical fluorides reviewed in this report and is not generalizable beyond this report. In addition, the NNT in this report was based on an annual caries increment of 1 DMFS in the control group.</p>
<p><strong>Generating Forest Plots</strong></p>
<p>Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted throughout to generate forest plots using Review Manager (RevMan) 5.1 software when there were two or more combinable trials. The random effects method (rather than the fixed effect method) is recommended when trial data are taken from the literature and likely do not represent the same population. The random effects model is more conservative in that the variance is composed of both the within-study and between-studies sampling errors. Individual study and summary effect estimates were weighted by the inverse of the variance according to standard methods.</p>
<p><strong>Statistical Heterogeneity</strong></p>
<p>Heterogeneity in study results typically arises from differences in study methodology and/or differences in the clinical aspects of the trial, such as populations, time period of the study, and/or topical fluoride dose. The panel assessed heterogeneity from the forest plots based on the I<sup>2</sup> statistic generated by Review Manager software. The statistical heterogeneity was interpreted as: I<sup>2</sup>&amp;lt;50% is low; 50&amp;lt;I<sup>2</sup>&amp;lt;75% is moderate; and I<sup>2</sup>&amp;gt;75% is high.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The authors are a multidisciplinary panel of experts convened by the American Dental Association (ADA) Council on Scientific Affairs (CSA) to present evidence-based clinical recommendations on professionally-applied and prescription-strength, home-use topical fluoride agents for caries prevention.</p>
<p>The authors addressed three clinical questions:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>In primary and permanent teeth, does the use of a topical fluoride compared to no topical fluoride reduce the incidence of new lesions, or arrest^ or reverse^ existing coronal and/or root caries? </li>
    <li>For primary and permanent teeth, is one topical fluoride agent more effective than another in reducing the incidence of, or arresting^ or reversing^ coronal and/or root caries? </li>
    <li>Does the use of prophylaxis before application of topical fluoride reduce the incidence of caries to a greater extent than topical fluoride application without prophylaxis? </li>
</ol>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>^Although the original clinical questions asked about arresting and reversing coronal and/or root caries, insufficient data were found to answer the question; therefore, these outcomes are not addressed in the clinical recommendations (see the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong>Process for Developing Evidence Statements</strong></p>
<p>The first step in this process was to systematically compare the 95% confidence interval of the summary effect estimate to the null for each intervention. If the 95% confidence interval of the summary effect estimate included the line of no effect (zero for difference measures such as standardized mean difference [SMD]), the topical fluoride was judged not to have an effect. If the 95% confidence interval of the summary effect estimate did not include the line of no effect, the topical fluoride was judged to have a statistically significant effect.</p>
<p>The next step in the development of evidence statements was to classify the level of certainty in the summary effect estimate as high, moderate, or low, according to a standardized grading system (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field). The level of certainty refers to the probability that the panel's assessment of the effect of an intervention is correct. The criteria for assessment include the risk of bias of the included studies, number of studies, number of participants, and statistical heterogeneity among the studies; the consistency in the magnitude and direction of the effect; and the generalizability of the findings to the populations of interest. The possibility of publication bias was not assessed, since there were not enough studies in any category to make a reliable judgment.</p>
<p>Finally, the panel used a consensus method to generate statements that summarized the evidence, including whether or not the intervention was shown to be beneficial, the level of certainty in the underlying evidence, and other clinical information with respect to the population, dentition type, and frequency of application for each topical fluoride agent that was reviewed. The evidence statements were approved by majority vote.</p>
<p><strong>Deviations from the Protocol</strong></p>
<p>Although the panel was interested in the effect of topical fluoride agents on the arrest and reversal of caries progression as stated in clinical question #1, insufficient evidence was found on these outcomes. Therefore, the panel decided to focus the clinical recommendations only on the reduction of caries increment as a measure of caries prevention.</p>
<p>Regarding clinical question #2, the panel was interested in the comparative effectiveness of different topical fluoride agents. Because insufficient evidence was found on which to base clinical recommendations, the panel was unable to address this question.</p>
<p><strong>Methods for Developing Clinical Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The panel developed clinical recommendations and graded the strength of the recommendations according to a standardized process. The expert panel ascertained the <em>net benefit rating</em> by judging the balance of benefits to the potential for harms. For example, if a topical fluoride was found to be effective, and the benefits were judged to outweigh the harms, the net benefit was &quot;benefit outweighs harms.&quot; The panel used the criteria displayed in Table 5 of the original guideline document to combine the <em>Level of Certainty</em> with the <em>Net Benefit Rating</em> to arrive at the strength of the recommendation (<em>Strong, In Favor, Weak, Expert Opinion For, Expert Opinion Against, or Against</em>). See the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field for definitions.</p>
<p>Note that as described in Table 4 in the original guideline document, for Low level of certainty (when evidence is insufficient or reliability of estimated effects is limited) and Table 5 in the original guideline document, the expert panel can still make a recommendation based on their collective judgment, based on the available evidence. Upon agreement that the level of certainty in the effect was low, and when the panel decided to make a clinical recommendation, the language of that recommendation was discussed and amended until a majority of the panel was satisfied, as assessed by vote.</p></div>"/>

<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Nausea and vomiting associated with the ingestion of topical fluorides. </li>
    <li>Dental fluorosis (an esthetic concern) while tooth enamel is developing until about age 6, due to daily ingestion of topical fluoride, such as from toothpaste or from prescription home use gels. There is less of a concern with professionally-applied topical fluorides that have much longer intervals between applications. Additionally, fluoride varnish has less potential for harms than other forms of high concentration topical fluoride because the amount of fluoride that is placed in the mouth with fluoride varnish is approximately one-tenth that of other professionally-applied products. </li>
</ul>
<p>The panel judged that the benefits outweighed the potential for harms for all professionally-applied or prescription-strength topical fluorides and age groups except for children under age 6, where the risk of swallowing and associated events (particularly nausea and vomiting) outweighed the potential benefits for all professionally-applied or prescription-strength topical fluorides except 2.26% fluoride varnish.</p></div>"/>
