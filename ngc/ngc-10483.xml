	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Patient Selection</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Contraindications for laparoscopic peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter placement include active abdominal infection and uncorrectable mechanical defects of the abdominal wall. (<strong>+++ Evidence, Strong recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>History of prior abdominal surgery, regardless of how many, is not a contraindication to laparoscopic PD catheter insertion. It is appropriate for surgeons with experience in advanced laparoscopy to attempt lysis of adhesions and catheter placement in these patients. (<strong>++ Evidence, Strong recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>Patients with abdominal wall hernias should be diagnosed and repaired before or at the same time as PD catheter insertion. A repair should be chosen that minimizes peritoneal dissection and does not place mesh intraperitoneally. (<strong>++ Evidence, Weak recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>Peritoneal dialysis may be initiated in patients with intraabdominal foreign bodies such as after open abdominal aortic aneurysm graft repair, but a four month waiting period is recommended. Very limited data exists regarding peritoneal dialysis in the presence of an adjustable gastric band. (<strong>++ Evidence, Weak recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>Peritoneal dialysis may be safely initiated in patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. (<strong>++ Evidence, Weak recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>Gastrostomy tubes can be used in pediatric patients on peritoneal dialysis, though placement by blind percutaneous endoscopic technique (PEG) appears to be associated with higher infection rates compared to open insertion. (<strong>++ Evidence, Weak recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>Laparoscopic PD catheter insertion with carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum requires general anesthesia. Patients who are high risk to undergo general anesthesia should be considered for a technique of catheter insertion that only requires local anesthesia and sedation, such as open insertion or fluoroscopically guided percutaneous insertion. Laparoscopic insertion using nitrous oxide pneumoperitoneum and local anesthesia is also an option where available. (<strong>++ Evidence, Weak recommendation</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Insertion Options</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;8&quot;>
    <li>For peritoneal access, blind percutaneous, open surgical, peritoneoscopic, fluoroscopically guided percutaneous, and laparoscopic insertion procedures, when performed by experienced operators, are feasible and safe with acceptable outcomes. (<strong>+++ Evidence, Strong recommendation</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Advanced Laparoscopic Techniques to Avoid Catheter Dysfunction</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;9&quot;>
    <li>Laparoscopic lysis of adhesions should be incorporated to reduce catheter dysfunction. (<strong>+++ Evidence, Strong recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>Laparoscopic suture fixation of the PD catheter may reduce catheter dysfunction but additional is needed. (<strong>++ Evidence, Weak recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>Rectus sheath tunneling helps prevent migration and may be superior to suture fixation since it does not require added ports and instruments. (<strong>++ Evidence, Weak recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>Omentopexy in adults is a safe adjunct to laparoscopic PD catheter insertion and should be incorporated either routinely or selectively to reduce catheter dysfunction. (<strong>+++ Evidence, Weak recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>Omentectomy should be considered in pediatric patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis catheter placement. (<strong>++ Evidence, Weak recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>The combination of lysis of adhesions, peritoneal tunneling and omentopexy in combination offers the lowest rate of postoperative PD catheter dysfunction and should be a preferred technique in adults. (<strong>+++ Evidence, Strong recommendation</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Perioperative Considerations</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;15&quot;>
    <li>Presurgical assessment should include thorough examination for hernias and the catheter exit site should be marked before surgery. (<strong>+ Evidence, Weak recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>A need for preoperative bowel preparation has not been conclusively demonstrated and further is needed before a recommendation can be provided. </li>
    <li>Prophylactic antibiotics should be used prior to laparoscopic insertion of PD catheter. Vancomycin may be superior to first generation cephalosporins in minimizing early peritonitis after PD insertion but local resistance patterns should be also considered when choosing the preoperative antibiotic. (<strong>+++ Evidence, Strong recommendation</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Surgical Technique</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;18&quot;>
    <li>Peritoneal access during lap PD insertion should be obtained away from previous scars; surgeons should use the technique they are most comfortable and experienced with. (<strong>++ Evidence, Weak recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>The surgeon should minimize the size and number of ports used and place them in a manner that optimizes visualization of the catheter peritoneal insertion point and the pelvis. (<strong>++ Evidence, Weak recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>When inserting the PD catheter through the abdominal wall, the deep cuff should be placed inside the rectus sheath. (<strong>++ Evidence, Strong recommendation</strong>). </li>
    <li>The superficial PD catheter cuff should be 2 cm from the skin exit site in children and at least 2 cm in adults to prevent future cuff extrusion. (<strong>+ Evidence, Weak recommendation</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Postoperative Protocol</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;22&quot;>
    <li>Minimizing dressing changes and handling may be beneficial in the first two postop weeks. (<strong>+ Evidence, Weak recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>Adequate time should be given after surgery for healing before PD is initiated and the current standard is two weeks. A more urgent start should be considered when the benefits outweigh the risks. (<strong>++ Evidence, Weak recommendation</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Comparative Studies in Adults</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary of Outcomes by Surgical Procedure</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;24&quot;>
    <li>Blind percutaneous PD catheter insertion has acceptable malfunction and leak rates compared with open insertion in patients who have never had prior abdominal surgery. The technique may be especially useful in high-risk patients for general anesthesia as it can be performed at the bedside, under local anesthesia by trained nephrologists. However, bowel perforation and bleeding risk should be considered. (<strong>+++ Evidence, Weak recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>Open surgical insertion continues to be a standard to which others are compared. It is safe (low perforation rate) and effective and can be performed under local anesthesia and sedation. It appears to have higher leak and dysfunction rates compared to image guided percutaneous and advanced laparoscopic insertion. (<strong>+++ Evidence, Weak recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>Peritoneoscopic insertion is a technique used worldwide, mostly by &quot;interventional&quot; nephrologists. It has been studied in patients who have had prior surgery, but there is at least a 1% perforation rate. It appears to be comparable to open surgical insertion in experienced hands, but has not been compared to laparoscopic and fluoroscopic guided percutaneous insertion. (<strong>++ Evidence, Weak recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>In patients without prior abdominal surgery, percutaneous fluoroscopic PD catheter insertion results in similar or better complication rates and dysfunction rates compared to open or basic laparoscopic insertion, and avoids general anesthesia. (<strong>+++ Evidence, Weak recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>Basic laparoscopic insertion without using techniques to minimize catheter dysfunction results in similar dysfunction rates as open insertion. (<strong>+++ Evidence, Strong recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>Advanced laparoscopic PD catheter insertion using lysis of adhesions, catheter fixation preferably with long rectus sheath tunnel, and omentopexy performed in combination has the lowest reported rate of catheter dysfunction in adults, even in patients with prior abdominal surgery. (<strong>+++ Evidence, Strong recommendation</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Early Postoperative Complications</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;30&quot;>
    <li>Bleeding after PD catheter insertion may occur from inferior epigastric artery injury or lysis of adhesions and should be managed according to standard surgical principles. The insertion point should be at the medial border of the rectus sheath to avoid arterial injury. Coagulation parameters should be assessed and corrected pre-operatively. (<strong>+ Evidence, Weak recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>Dialysate leaks after PD catheter placement may be amenable to treatment, and potentially prevention, with the use of fibrin glue, particularly in the pediatric population. (<strong>++ Evidence, Weak recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>Exit site infection is managed by oral antibiotics. Chronic exit site and cuff infections may be managed by catheter salvage consisting of unroofing the track, shaving the superficial cuff and using a new exit site. (<strong>++ Evidence, Weak recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>Pain during PD is a rare complication that is usually amenable to medical management but occasionally requires repositioning or removal of the catheter. (<strong>++ Evidence, Weak recommendation</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>PD Catheter Malfunction</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;34&quot;>
    <li>Malfunctioning PD catheters should be evaluated by physical examination and plain radiographs to rule out constipation. If negative, further studies such as catheterography or computed tomography (CT) peritoneography, followed by diagnostic laparoscopy are indicated. (<strong>++ Evidence, Weak recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>Non-operative treatments of malfunctioning PD catheters which have been proven effective include flushing, thrombolytics and fluoroscopic wire manipulation. (<strong>++ Evidence, Weak recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>Patients with malfunctioning peritoneal dialysis catheters not amenable to nonoperative measures should undergo laparoscopy with catheter repositioning, adhesiolysis, omentectomy or omentopexy. Patency should be assured by stripping and flushing. Suture fixation of the catheter to the pelvis or polypropylene sling may be utilized to reduce catheter migration.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>A systematic literature search was performed on MEDLINE in May 2010 and was updated January 2013. Articles were limited to English language. Additional articles found on the latest search were included in the totals and incorporated into the guideline final draft. The search strategy is detailed in Figure 1 of the original guideline document. The search strategy identified 66 articles on laparoscopic insertion of peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheters. Of these 37 were on salvage and 14 on peritoneoscopic insertion. The abstracts were reviewed by two committee members and divided into the following categories:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Randomized studies, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews </li>
    <li>Prospective studies </li>
    <li>Retrospective studies </li>
    <li>Case reports </li>
    <li>Review articles </li>
    <li>Clinical practice guidelines </li>
</ol>
<p>Randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews were selected for further review along with prospective and retrospective studies when a higher level of evidence was lacking. For inclusion, prospective and retrospective studies had to report outcomes on at least 30 laparoscopic PD catheter insertions. Studies with smaller samples were considered when additional evidence was lacking. The most recent reviews were also included. All case reports, old reviews, and smaller studies were excluded. Duplicate publications or patient populations were considered only once. Whenever the available evidence from Level I studies was considered to be adequate, lower evidence level studies were not considered.</p>
<p>The reviewers graded the level of evidence and searched the bibliography of each article for additional articles that may have been missed during the original search. Additional relevant articles were obtained and included in the review for grading. A separate search pertaining to pediatric patients was undertaken in 2013. The search strategy is outlined in Figure 2 in the original guideline document. Due to lower case numbers, prospective and retrospective studies in pediatric patients had to report outcomes on at least 15 peritoneal dialysis catheter insertions. Studies with smaller samples were considered when additional evidence was lacking. Forty-five articles relevant to pediatric patients were reviewed by a committee member.</p></div>"/>

    <li>Guidelines for clinical practice are intended to indicate preferable approaches to medical problems as established by experts in the field. These recommendations will be based on existing data or a consensus of expert opinion when little or no data are available. Guidelines are applicable to all physicians who address the clinical problem(s) without regard to specialty training or interests, and are intended to indicate the preferable, but not necessarily the only acceptable approaches due to the complexity of the healthcare environment. Guidelines are intended to be flexible. Given the wide range of specifics in any health care problem, the surgeon must always choose the course best suited to the individual patient and the variables in existence at the moment of decision. </li>
    <li>Guidelines are developed under the auspices of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons and its various committees, and approved by the Board of Governors. Each clinical practice guideline has been systematically researched, reviewed and revised by the guidelines committee, and reviewed by an appropriate multidisciplinary team. The recommendations are therefore considered valid at the time of its production based on the data available. Each guideline is scheduled for periodic review to allow incorporation of pertinent new developments in medical research knowledge, and practice. </li>
