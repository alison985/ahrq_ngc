<p><strong>Summary Tables: Recommendations and Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Table 1 summarizes the recommendations from the Evidence-based Practice Hip Panel for diagnostic testing for hip and groin disorders. Table 2 is a summary of recommendations for managing these disorders. Table 3 is a summary of pre-, peri-, and post-operative rehabilitation recommendations related to these disorders. Recommendations are based on critically appraised higher quality research evidence, and on expert consensus, observing First Principles when higher quality evidence was unavailable or inconsistent. The reader is cautioned to utilize the more detailed indications, specific appropriate diagnoses, temporal sequencing, prior testing or treatment, and contraindications that are elaborated in more detail for each test or treatment in the body of this Guideline in using these recommendations in clinical practice or medical management. These recommendations are not simple &quot;yes/no&quot; criteria, and the evidence supporting them is in nearly all circumstances developed from typical patients, not unusual situations or exceptions.</p>
<p>Recommendations are made under the following categories:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Strongly Recommended, &quot;A&quot; Level </li>
    <li>Moderately Recommended, &quot;B&quot; Level </li>
    <li>Recommended, &quot;C&quot; Level </li>
    <li>Insufficient-Recommended (Consensus-based), &quot;I&quot; Level </li>
    <li>Insufficient-No Recommendation (Consensus-based), &quot;I&quot; Level </li>
    <li>Insufficient-Not Recommended (Consensus-based), &quot;I&quot; Level </li>
    <li>Not Recommended, &quot;C&quot; Level </li>
    <li>Moderately Not Recommended, &quot;B&quot; Level </li>

<p><strong>Ranking and Preliminary Screening of Studies</strong></p>
<p>Primary sources selected for inclusion in the evidence base for American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (ACOEM) products and services are limited to those with the strongest apparent study design, pending quality rating. The strength and quality of study design are determined by ranking and rating of the studies according to accepted methods. Generally accepted ranking of study design for diagnostic testing and clinical treatment methods were modified by the Guideline Methodology Committee (GMC). Systematic reviews in general are not ranked as the best design in reality, as most reviews located during pilot testing of the Methodology, with the exception of many (but not all) Cochrane reviews, did not use systematic searches or quality assessments of included studies. The GMC also excluded level 4 evidence from consideration (case series, poor-quality cohort studies, poor-quality case-control studies, expert opinion without explicit critical appraisal, and expert opinion based on physiology, bench research, first principles). The focus was on the best-designed original studies, pending quality grading. For example, studies of diagnostic tests are generally limited to those compared to an acceptable gold standard, and those reporting sensitivity and specificity. Studies of clinical treatment methods are generally limited to randomized controlled trials or crossover trials. Additional literature was also reviewed when there was a paucity of higher-grade literature or if it was brought to Evidence-based Practice Panel's (EBPP's) attention from interested parties.</p>
<p>To narrow the data discovered in the search to that which will be acceptable for further analysis and quality rating, researchers use additional preliminary screening criteria for original research.</p>
<p><strong>Criteria for Inclusion in Study Rating and Critical Analysis of Studies of Diagnosis/Clinical Assessment Methods</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Evaluate the efficacy (i.e., clinical accuracy) of the assessment method (i.e., the &quot;test&quot;) in a group that contains subjects both with and without the condition the test is intended to assess. </li>
    <li>Be a prospective cohort study or an arm of an randomized controlled trial (RCT). </li>
    <li>Compare the findings of the assessment method (test) to an adequate reference standard for all subjects (not just subjects who tested positive). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Criteria for Inclusion in Study Rating and Critical Analysis of Studies of Treatment Efficacy</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Evaluate a group of subjects with a representative spectrum of the clinical condition of interest. </li>
    <li>Be a randomized controlled trial evaluating clinical outcomes in a group receiving the intervention compared to a comparison group receiving either no intervention or a different intervention. </li>
    <li>Evaluate functional outcomes that are important to a patient's overall health or well being or are important to society. </li>
</ol>
<p>Searches are documented, listing the database searched, the search terms, article type and limits, the time frame searched (in this case, all years in the databases), the number of studies found, the number reviewed in detail, and the number included in the systematic analysis. Despite multiple database searches, many additional studies are discovered in exhaustive manual searches of article reference lists.</p></div>"/>

<p>Studies are first abstracted into evidence tables for easier assessment. See Appendix B in the methodology companion (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for a sample of an evidence table for treatment studies. Each study is formally graded for quality using a modification of the most recent assessment scheme proposed by the Cochrane Collaboration Back Group, as shown in the table below. The studies are quality rated using a 0, 0.5, 1 grade for each item, where 0 = does not fulfill the requirement; 0.5 = partially fulfills the requirement and 1 = entirely fulfills the requirement. A study with a score less than 4.0 is rated as a poor-quality study; a study with a score between 4.0 and 7.5 is rated as a moderate-quality study. A study with a score of 8.0 or greater is rated as a high-quality study.</p>

<p>The Evidence-based Practice Panels (EBPPs) for each topic area review and discuss draft practice recommendations from the research staff that includes a review of the quality evidence, evidence tables, and summaries. The strength of evidence rating is confirmed by the EBPP responsible for the topic, with review by the Guideline Methodology Committee (GMC). EBPP members may present additional comments related to their clinical opinions and experience for panel consideration. If a unanimous decision is not possible, an EBPP may vote on the rating of the strength of the evidence to determine a consensus. Dissenters to the consensus may draft minority opinions about the strength of evidence. In practice, this has not happened as recommendations have been unanimous.</p>
<p>Formulation of recommendations requires clinical judgment as well as a full evaluation and consideration of the available high-quality evidence. To aid in framing recommendations, the GMC developed a list of &quot;First Principles&quot; based on the Hippocratic Oath (&quot;First Do No Harm&quot;), medical logic, appropriate sequencing and case management, shared decision-making, support of functional recovery, and relative cost-effectiveness. The First Principles are defined in Table 7 in the methodology companion (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). When there is insufficient high-quality evidence of effectiveness or efficacy, or the high-quality evidence is conflicting, and to guide recommendations for alternative tests or treatments when there are several options, these principles are used to guide group decision-making.</p>
<p>The EBPPs then assign a Strength of Recommendation to each recommendation. If a consensus cannot be reached on the recommendation or strength of recommendation, the EBPPs may use nominal group voting if agreement is not possible in the discussion. Once a consensus is reached, the EBPPs will finalize the language and strength rating of the recommendation. If needed and material, a minority opinion can be appended to the recommendation.</p></div>"/>

<p>The Guideline Methodology Committee (GMC) assigns a committee member to each Evidence Based Practice Panel (EBPP) as a methodology consultant to assist with adherence to this methodology. The GMC reviews all recommendations for which there are questions about consistency with the defined methodology. If the GMC determines that the approved methodology has not been followed, leading to illogical or untenable recommendations, the GMC engages in direct discussions with the EBPP to reach agreement on revision. If there is no agreement or revision, then the matter will be considered by the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (ACOEM) Board of Directors when the document is submitted for Board review.</p>
<p><strong>External Review</strong></p>
<p>ACOEM conducts external peer review of the ACOEM Occupational Medicine Practice Guidelines (APGs) and periodic revisions to 1) assure that all relevant high-quality scientific literature has been found, 2) assure that the important evidence from the relevant scientific literature relevant has been accurately interpreted, 3) solicit opinions on whether the findings and recommendation statements are appropriate and consistent with the evidence, and 4) obtain general information on the conclusions and presentation of materials from external topic experts. Professional and patient organizations, as well as panel members, ACOEM Board of Directors, etc., are invited to nominate external peer reviewers.</p>
<p>Peer reviewers are asked to comment on the completeness of the scientific literature evaluation in their topic area, the clarity and technical accuracy of the APGs evaluation and summary of the evidence, and the appropriateness of the Guideline findings and recommendation statements.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Input</strong></p>
<p>In a cyclical manner, ACOEM will seek stakeholder input to understand the needs and preferences of those who may utilize or be affected by the use of clinical practice guidelines in workplace settings and in the workers' compensation system. ACOEM solicits input from clinicians, health care systems, workers or patients, employers, utilization reviewers, case managers, insurers and third party administrators, attorneys, regulators, and policy makers through a variety of mechanisms. Stakeholders will be asked for comments about their experience using existing clinical practice guidelines and related products and their suggestions for future improvements. They are also asked for input on the use of clinical practice guidelines in clinical care, case management, claim administration, claim adjudication, and in the development of policies and regulations.</p>
<p>To ensure editorial independence in the development process, the stakeholder groups will be asked for input about the APGs, but will not be informed of panel deliberations or shown drafts of practice recommendations before the formal release of the documents. In some cases, a member of a stakeholder group may participate as a member of a Guideline EBPP or may participate in peer review or pilot testing. However, all individuals involved in the APGs development, peer review, and pilot testing are asked to keep all information about the panel's deliberations and conclusions confidential until the APGs are formally released.</p>
<p><strong>Pilot Testing</strong></p>
<p>The guidelines are pilot tested to determine if the recommendations are clear, easy to use, and are generally useful. Pilot testers are not asked if they think the recommendations or process for development was appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Review by the GMC and the ACOEM Board of Directors</strong></p>
<p>During the entire evidence-based product development process, the GMC will work with the Panels, editors, and research staff to ensure that the evidence-based product methodology is being followed, both in the literature evaluation process and development of conclusion and recommendation statements. The Board of Directors has an opportunity to comment on the Guidelines during the external review period.

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>

    <li>False-positive or false-negative diagnostic tests </li>
    <li>Risks and complications of surgical procedures and imaging studies (e.g., infection, radiation). Dislocations are among the most common post-operative complications. </li>
    <li>Gastrointestinal bleeding is associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). </li>
    <li>Adverse effects of bisphosphonates include gastritis, reflux esophagitis (can be severe and erosive causing stricture and achalasia), and osteonecrosis of the jaw (uncommon). </li>
    <li>Adverse effects of calcitonin are relatively rare and include nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, injection site reactions, nasal symptoms, rhinitis, sinusitis, anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, hypersensitivity reactions, osteogenic sarcoma, and hypocalcemic tetany. </li>
    <li>Adverse effects with opioids appear prominent, especially during introduction and/or dose adjustment. These include effects on the central nervous system (CNS) (drowsiness, somnolence, fatigue, tolerance) and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (constipation, nausea, dyspepsia), although there are other CNS and GI effects, as well as effects on the cardiovascular, respiratory, dermatologic, endocrine, and musculoskeletal systems. Tolerance, addiction, and drug-seeking behaviors are common. Approximately 80% of patients experience some adverse effects from opioids and approximately 33% to 66% do not finish a clinical trial with opioids due primarily to these adverse effects (the large range in estimates is due to trial design such as whether a wash-out phase was included, length of treatment, and severity of pain). </li>
    <li>Generally, major bleeding is the most significant adverse effect of most of the medications used to prevent venous thromboembolic disease (VTED). </li>
    <li>The adverse effect profile of skeletal muscle relaxants is concerning, with CNS sedation rates ranging from approximately 25% to 50% and a low but definite risk of abuse. Thus, prescriptions for skeletal muscle relaxants for daytime use should be carefully weighed against the need to drive vehicles, operate machinery, or otherwise engage in occupations where mistakes in judgment may have serious consequences (e.g., crane operators, air traffic controllers, construction workers, etc.). </li>
    <li>Complications of hip arthroplasty include bone cement implantation syndrome (BCIS), fat emboli, intraoperative fractures, infected prostheses, dislocations and prothesis failure. </li>
