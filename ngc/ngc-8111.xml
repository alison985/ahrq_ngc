	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong>Recommendation No 1: Develop a Physician-Patient Relationship for Shared Decision-Making</strong></p>
<p>Shared decision-making is the recognized preferred model for medical decision-making because it addresses the ethical need to fully inform patients about the risks and benefits of treatments, as well as the need to ensure that patients' values and preferences play a prominent role. Because of the number and complexity of decisions involved in treating kidney failure, a shared decision-making relationship is particularly important for patients with acute kidney injury (AKI); stage 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD); and stage 5 CKD requiring dialysis end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Participants in shared decision-making should involve at a minimum the patient and the physician. In addition, patients should identify and include a person who could serve as their decision maker in the event they lose decision-making capacity. If a patient lacks decision-making capacity, decisions should involve the person legally authorized to make health care decisions on behalf of the incapacitated patient. This person is often (though not always) a family member and will be called &quot;the legal agent&quot; in the remainder of this document (see Section 10: Glossary in the full version of the current guideline for a full description). With the patient's consent, shared decision-making may include family members or friends and other members of the health care team.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Informing Patients</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation No 2: Fully Inform AKI, Stage 4 and 5 CKD, and ESRD Patients about Their Diagnosis, Prognosis, and All Treatment Options</strong></p>
<p>In the setting of critical illness many patients with CKD will require urgent dialysis and the vast majority of patients with AKI will have multiple medical problems, in addition to kidney failure. The concept of shared decision making necessitates a multidisciplinary approach including nephrologists, intensivists, and others as appropriate and decisions about acute renal replacement therapy should be made in the context of other life-sustaining treatments. For example, a decision to withhold dialysis in a patient agreeing to and receiving multiple other forms of life sustaining therapy could represent discordant treatment in the same way that offering dialysis to a patient who has decided to forgo other forms of life-sustaining therapy might be inappropriate. Intensive care physicians need to be included in shared decision making for kidney patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).</p>
<p>For ESRD patients, these options in shared decision-making include: 1) available dialysis modalities and kidney transplantation if applicable; 2) not starting dialysis and continuing medical management; 3) a time limited trial of dialysis, and 4) stopping dialysis and receiving end-of-life care. Choices among options should be made by patients or, if patients lack decision-making capacity, their designated legal agents. Their decisions should be informed and voluntary. The renal care team, in conjunction with the primary care physician, should insure that the patient or legal agent understands the benefits and burdens of dialysis and the consequences of not starting or stopping dialysis. Research studies have identified a population of chronic kidney disease patients for whom the prognosis is particularly poor. This population has been found to include patients with two or more of the following characteristics: 1) elderly (defined by research studies identifying poor outcomes in patients who are age 75 years and older); 2) patients with high comorbidity scores (e.g., modified Charlson Comorbidity Index score of 8 or greater); 3) marked functional impairment (e.g., Karnofsky Performance Status Scale score of less than 40); and 4) severe chronic malnutrition (e.g., serum albumin level less than 2.5 g/dL using the bromcresol green method). Patients in this population should be informed that dialysis may not confer a survival advantage or improve functional status over medical management without dialysis and that dialysis entails significant burdens that may detract from their quality of life.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendation No. 3: Give All Patients with AKI, Stage 5 CKD, or ESRD an Estimate of Prognosis Specific to Their Overall Condition</strong></p>
<p>To facilitate informed decisions about starting dialysis for AKI, stage 5 CKD, or ESRD, all patients should have their prognosis estimated and discussed, with the realization that the ability to predict survival in the individual patient is limited. Depending on the setting, a primary care physician, intensivist, or nephrologist who is familiar with estimating and communicating prognosis should conduct these discussions (see Recommendation No. 10 for communication strategies). For patients with ESRD, the &quot;surprise&quot; question &quot;Would I be surprised if this patient died in the next year?&quot; can be used together with known risk factors for poor prognosis: age, comorbidities, severe malnutrition, and poor functional status. For patients with stage 5 CKD pre-dialysis, the estimate of prognosis should be discussed with the patient or legal agent, patient's family, and among the medical team members to develop a consensus on the goals of care and whether dialysis or active medical management without dialysis should be used to best achieve these goals. These discussions should occur as early as possible in the course of the patient's kidney disease and continue as the kidney disease progresses. For ESRD patients on dialysis who experience major complications that may substantially reduce survival or quality of life, it is appropriate to reassess treatment goals, including consideration of withdrawal from dialysis.</p>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Facilitating Advance Care Planning</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation No. 4: Institute Advance Care Planning</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of advance care planning is to help the patient understand his/her condition, identify his/her goals for care, and prepare for the decisions that may have to be made as the condition progresses over time. For chronic dialysis patients, the interdisciplinary renal care team should encourage patient-family discussion and advance care planning and include advance care planning in the overall plan of care for each individual patient. The renal care team should designate a person to be primarily responsible for ensuring that advance care planning is offered to each patient. Patients with decision-making capacity should be strongly encouraged to talk to their legal agents while they still have capacity to ensure that the legal agent knows the patient's wishes and agrees to make decisions according to these wishes.</p>
<p>The renal care team should attempt to obtain written advance directives from all dialysis patients. Where legally accepted, Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) or similar state-specific forms, also should be completed as part of the advance care planning process. At a minimum, each dialysis patient should be asked to designate a legal agent in a state-specific advance directive. Advance directives should be honored by dialysis centers, nephrologists, and other nephrology clinicians except possibly in situations in which the advance directive requests treatment contrary to the standard of care (see Recommendation No. 8 on conflict resolution).</p>

<p><strong>Recommendation No. 5*: If Appropriate, Forgo (Withhold Initiation or Withdraw Ongoing) Dialysis for Patients with AKI, CKD, or ESRD in Certain, Well-defined Situations</strong></p>
<p>These situations include the following:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Patients with decision-making capacity, who being fully informed and making voluntary choices, refuse dialysis or request that dialysis be discontinued. </li>
    <li>Patients who no longer possess decision making capacity who have previously indicated refusal of dialysis in an oral or written advance directive. </li>
    <li>Patients who no longer possess decision making capacity and whose properly appointed legal agents/surrogates refuse dialysis or request that it be discontinued. </li>
    <li>Patients with irreversible, profound neurological impairment such that they lack signs of thought, sensation, purposeful behavior, and awareness of self and environment. </li>
</ul>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*Medical management incorporating palliative care is an integral part of the decision to forgo dialysis in AKI, CKD, or ESRD, and attention to patient comfort and quality of life while dying should be addressed directly or managed by palliative care consultation and referral to a hospice program (see Recommendation No. 9 on palliative care services).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation No. 6: Consider Forgoing Dialysis for AKI, CKD, or ESRD Patients Who Have a Very Poor Prognosis or for Whom Dialysis Cannot Be Provided Safely</strong></p>
<p>Included in these categories of patients are the following:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Those whose medical condition precludes the technical process of dialysis because the patient is unable to cooperate (e.g., advanced dementia patient who pulls out dialysis needles) or because the patient's condition is too unstable (e.g., profound hypotension). </li>
    <li>Those who have a terminal illness from non-renal causes (acknowledging that some in this condition may perceive benefit from and choose to undergo dialysis). </li>
    <li>Those with stage 5 CKD older than age 75 years who meet two or more of the following statistically significant very poor prognosis criteria (see Recommendations No. 2 and 3): 1) clinicians' response of &quot;No, I would not be surprised&quot; to the surprise question; 2) high comorbidity score; 3) significantly impaired functional status (e.g., Karnofsky Performance Status score less than 40); and 4) severe chronic malnutrition (i.e., serum albumin less than 2.5 g/dL using the bromcresol green method). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Resolving Conflicts about What Dialysis Decisions to Make</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation No. 7: Consider a Time-Limited Trial of Dialysis for Patients Requiring Dialysis, But Who Have an Uncertain Prognosis, or for Whom a Consensus Cannot Be Reached about Providing Dialysis</strong></p>
<p>If a time-limited trial of dialysis is conducted, the nephrologist, the patient, the patient's legal agent, and the patient's family (with the patient's permission to participate in decision-making) should agree in advance on the length of the trial and parameters to be assessed during and at the completion of the time limited trial to determine whether dialysis has benefited the patient and whether dialysis should be continued.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation No. 8: Establish a Systematic Due Process Approach for Conflict Resolution if There Is Disagreement about What Decision Should Be Made with Regard to Dialysis</strong></p>
<p>Conflicts may occur between the patient/legal agent and the renal care team about whether dialysis will benefit the patient. Conflicts also may occur within the renal care team or between the renal care team and other health care providers. In talking with patients/legal agents, the nephrologist should try to understand their views, provide data to support his/her recommendation, and correct misunderstandings. In the process of shared decision-making, the following potential sources of conflict have been recognized: 1) miscommunication or misunderstanding about prognosis; 2) intrapersonal or interpersonal issues; or 3) special values. If dialysis is indicated emergently, it should be provided while pursuing conflict resolution, provided the patient or legal agent requests it.</p>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Providing Effective Palliative Care</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation No. 9: To Improve Patient-Centered Outcomes, Offer Palliative Care Services and Interventions to All AKI, CKD, and ESRD Patients Who Suffer from Burdens of Their Disease</strong></p>
<p>Palliative care services are appropriate for people who chose to undergo or remain on dialysis and for those who choose not to start or to discontinue dialysis. With the patient's consent, a multi-professional team with expertise in renal palliative care, including nephrology professionals, family or community-based professionals, and specialist hospice or palliative care providers, should be involved in managing the physical, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects of treatment for these patients, including end-of life care. Physical and psychological symptoms should be routinely and regularly assessed and actively managed. The professionals providing treatment should be trained in assessing and managing symptoms and in advanced communication skills. Patients should be offered the option of dying where they prefer, including at home with hospice care, provided there is sufficient and appropriate support to enable this option. Support also should be offered to patients' families, including bereavement support where appropriate. Dialysis patients for whom the goals of care are primarily comfort should have quality measures distinct from patients for whom the goals are aggressive therapy with optimization of functional capacity.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendation No. 10: Use a Systematic Approach to Communicate about Diagnosis, Prognosis, Treatment Options, and Goals of Care</strong></p>
<p>Good communication improves patients' adjustment to illness, increases adherence to treatment, and results in higher patient and family satisfaction with care. Patients appreciate sensitive delivery of information about their prognosis and the ability to balance reality while maintaining hope. In communicating with patients, the critical task for clinicians is to integrate complicated biomedical facts and conditions with emotional, social, and spiritual realities that are equally complex but not well described in the language of medicine. This information must be communicated in a way that patients, legal agents, and families can understand and use to reach informed decisions about dialysis and transplantation options. Patients' decisions should be based on an accurate understanding of their condition and the pros and cons of treatment options. To facilitate effective communication, reliance upon a multidisciplinary approach including nephrologists, intensivists, and others as appropriate is warranted. Decisions about acute renal replacement therapy in AKI should be made in the context of other life-sustaining treatments. Intensive care physicians should be included in shared decision-making for kidney patients in the ICU to facilitate discussions on global disease or injury prognosis. Fellowship programs should incorporate training to help nephrologists develop effective, empathetic communication skills, which are essential in caring for this patient population.</p>

<p><strong>Search Strategy for Relevant Research Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Pertinent English language literature published from 1985 to December 1998 was identified from the following:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, HealthStar, PsycINFO, and EMBASE) </li>
    <li>References from articles </li>
    <li>Experts </li>
    <li>Hand searches of eight medical and nephrology journals of issues covering the last six months of 1998 </li>
</ul>
<p>Research evidence based on data collected before 1985 was not sought because marked technological advances in dialysis delivery have occurred since that time. Preliminary searches of electronic databases using specific search terms, such as dialysis, acute renal failure or end-stage renal disease and withdrawal, preferences, prognosis, or quality of life, did not adequately capture the array of literature of interest to the Working Group. Thus a very broad search strategy was used; it only included terms for dialysis, end-stage renal disease, and acute renal failure, and it excluded unpublished studies, case reports, editorials, and letters.</p>
<p><strong>Selection of Relevant Research Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Selection criteria guided the selection of several types of information that were deemed relevant to the key questions (see Table 2 in the full version of the current guideline). For information about prognosis in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), large retrospective or prospective cohort studies with at least 100 patients that examined multivariate predictors of mortality or morbidity were selected. For information about prognosis in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), smaller retrospective or prospective studies involving at least 20 dialysis patients and reporting mortality outcomes were used. Information relevant to who gets referred for dialysis and when, feasibility, withdrawal frequencies and reasons, patient preferences, shared decision-making, advance directives, and quality of life assessments was taken from descriptive surveys, case-control studies, cohort studies, or randomized trials with at least 20 patients who were receiving or awaiting dialysis. Research evidence from Asian and developing countries was not used because differences in access to dialysis, patients' values and preferences, and decision-making processes were considered likely to limit generalizability and applicability to patients in the United States.</p>
<p>Abstracts of the 5,283 potentially eligible records were screened by at least two persons to identify those meeting selection criteria. Of these, 4,718 were excluded, usually because they addressed short-term complications, physiologic parameters, management or adequacy of dialysis, or because they did not contain primary data. The full texts of the remaining 565 articles were retrieved and reviewed by at least two persons to ascertain final eligibility. Of 329 articles meeting criteria, 29 contained information from the same study populations leaving 300 unique studies for review. A physician with clinical and methodological expertise resolved disagreements about eligibility criteria.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Second Edition (2010)</span></strong></p>
<p>The Renal Physician Association (RPA) sponsored the development of the second edition of this guideline using essentially the same methodology as the original guideline. In late 2002, the RPA considered doing a revision but found insufficient new information to warrant it at that time. The RPA revisited the issue more recently, found sufficient new evidence, and the RPA Quality, Safety, and Accountability Committee oversaw this guideline revision. For this revision, pertinent adult and pediatric English language literature published from January 2003 to October 2009 was identified from the following:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>PubMed </li>
    <li>References from articles </li>
    <li>Experts </li>
    <li>Hand searches of medical and nephrology journals </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the search terms used in the original guideline development, palliative care and end-of-life care were also included. Figure 5 in the full version of the current guideline includes a diagram of the article selection process for the guideline revision.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>2013 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>In December 2013 a systematic literature review of the literature on which the RPA guideline was based was performed by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) participants in the KDIGO Controversies Conference on Supportive/Palliative Care in Chronic Kidney Disease, many of whom helped to develop the 2010 guideline.</p>
<p>For this systematic literature review, pertinent adult English language literature published from October 1, 2009 through December 5, 2013 was identified from the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect; references from articles; national and international experts; and hand searches of medical and nephrology journals.</p>
<p>In 2013 the search terms used included those in the first and second edition of the clinical practice guideline, and the search was supplemented with the additional following terms: dialysis or chronic kidney disease AND prognosis, pain, symptoms, advance care planning, shared decision-making, palliative care, end-of-life care, conservative management, initiation, withholding, withdrawal, cost effectiveness, ethics, health economics, or costs. Also searched were combinations of &amp;ldquo;education,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;shared decision-making,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;dialysis,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;withholding,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;withdrawing,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;modality,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;palliative care,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;supportive care&amp;rdquo; AND &amp;ldquo;choice,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;pre-dialysis&amp;rdquo; AND &amp;ldquo;withholding,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;dialysis&amp;rdquo; AND &amp;ldquo;withdrawal,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;religion,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;culture,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;ethnicity,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;end of life,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;palliative care,&amp;rdquo; dialysis&amp;rdquo; AND &amp;ldquo;cost-effectiveness,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;palliative OR hospice&amp;rdquo; AND &amp;ldquo;cost-effectiveness,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;ethics in dialysis,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;shared decision making,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;time limited trial,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;palliative care in nephrology.&amp;rdquo;</p>

<p>Standard forms were used to abstract data from each study. Such data included information about study purposes and designs, participant descriptors, methodological characteristics, outcome measures, and results. Items related to the internal validity of studies that were assessed included: selective recruitment of study participants, problematic outcome assessment, high drop-out or nonresponse rates, discordance with current standards of care, confounding cointerventions, inappropriate analysis, and inadequate power.</p>
<p>Thirty-five individuals participated in the abstraction process. To aid standardization of abstraction, teams of abstractors were assigned articles related to specific thematic areas, such as prognosis of acute kidney injury (AKI), prognosis of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), feasibility of dialysis, referral of patients for dialysis, quality of life of dialysis patients, withdrawal of dialysis, preferences, decision-making capacity, and advance directives. Working Group members were assigned to thematic teams based upon their clinical or methodological expertise. Disagreements between abstractors were resolved by the Work Group chair.</p>
<p><strong>Levels of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The criteria that were used to rate the quality of evidence are described in Table 3 of the full version of the current guideline. Criteria for grading evidence addressing therapy, prevention, and prognosis were adapted from those of the Centre for Evidence-based Medicine at Oxford (<a href=&quot;http://www.cebm.net/index.aspx?o=1025&quot; title=&quot;CEBM Web site&quot;>www.cebm.net/index.aspx?o=1025</a>). Criteria for rating observational evidence were developed by the San Antonio Evidence-based Practice Center. The text in the rationales for each recommendation gives the ranking for the body of research evidence relevant to individual statements. When multiple relevant studies of varying quality were available, the evidence was rated according to the highest ranked study. Meta-analysis was not used to quantitatively summarize study data because of marked heterogeneity in study designs and study populations, and because quantitative techniques for summarizing prognostic studies that use multivariate analysis are not well developed.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>2010 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>In developing the original guideline, the Renal Physicians Association (RPA) and the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) selected the topic, committed resources towards its development, and organized the creation of a multidisciplinary Working Group to oversee the development process. The RPA and ASN appointed a steering panel that was charged with framing the scope of the guideline, identifying the relevant stakeholders and groups that should be represented on the multidisciplinary Working Group, and outlining the requirements for technical and administrative contractor support to develop the guideline. The panel selected staff from the San Antonio Evidence-Based Practice Center (EPC) and VA Cochrane Center to provide such support using methodology adapted from the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) guideline process and outlined in the American Medical Association's Attributes for Clinical Practice Guideline Development document. The RPA and ASN announced the guideline process in mid-1998 and invited interested parties to share pertinent ideas and comments with members of the Working Group and the San Antonio EPC/VA Cochrane Center.</p>
<p>The Working Group formulated specific guideline recommendations, taking into account several parameters: 1) ethical principles; 2) legal statutes; 3) shared decision-making; 4) the amount, type, quality, and consistency of supporting research evidence; and 5) the anticipated feasibility of implementation. There was considerable heterogeneity in the types of questions that the Working Group posed and in the types of research studies that were deemed relevant to those questions. Most often, relevant studies were prognostic cohort studies or observational studies (e.g., surveys, case series) that provided descriptive information. In a few instances, randomized controlled trial evidence was considered relevant.</p>
<p>Two analytic frameworks, one for acute kidney injury (AKI) and one for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), were developed to provide a conceptual framework for decisions about withholding or withdrawing dialysis. The models are presented in Figures 3 and 4 in the full version of the current guideline. They depict a dynamic chronological sequence of decision-making that is informed by multiple factors, such as patient preferences, prognosis, and feasibility of dialysis.</p>
<p>The Working Group proposed and prioritized key questions related to the models using a combined nominal and modified Delphi process. Questions specified information that was either desirable or necessary to make informed and ethical decisions about withholding or withdrawing dialysis. Such questions were categorized as directly informative to the evidence model or as background and contextual in nature. These key questions guided analysis of the evidence. The specific evidence questions for decision-making about dialysis in AKI and ESRD are listed in the full version of the current guideline.</p>
<p>The Working Group was provided with background information regarding principles of ethical decision-making. They were also given information regarding guideline development processes and desirable attributes of performance measures that may be used to help insure guideline implementation. They were provided with evidence tables that summarized the available research evidence relevant to the analytic framework questions. Based on these materials, teams within the Working Group formulated draft guideline recommendations. A general consensus process involving the entire group was used to reach agreement on final recommendations.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>2013 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>The Working Group affirmed the validity of the present guideline and concluded that there was not a need to revise the guideline at this time.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Dissemination and Educational Initiatives</strong></p>
<p>A first step in Guideline implementation is dissemination and education. The Working Group recommends that the Guideline document be disseminated throughout the End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Networks, as well as to individual providers. They also recommended incorporation of the Guideline into nephrology and critical care fellowship training programs and continuing education workshops for practicing renal care professionals. ESRD Networks, professional organizations, and/or providers may use the guidelines to develop patient education materials. Training programs and workshops should provide opportunities for participants to develop and practice skills necessary for implementing the guidelines, such as skills in advance care planning, palliative care, and communication.</p>
<p><strong>Local Implementation</strong></p>
<p>Clinical practice guidelines are successful only to the extent that they improve patient care and outcomes. The limited data available suggest substantial variation among dialysis facilities with regard to advance care planning, completion of advance directives, and provider/patient (family or legal agent) communication regarding treatment options (including the right to refuse dialysis). One of the fundamental principles of Quality Improvement (QI) is that opportunities for improvement exist whenever there is variability in process and outcomes. Chronic kidney disease clinics, dialysis facilities and their patients could benefit from QI activities that seek to increase communication and shared decision-making between providers and patients or their legal agents regarding treatment and end-of-life decisions.</p>
<p>Quality improvement consists of a cycle of identifying areas in need of improvement, setting achievable goals, targeting activities to achieve these goals, and remeasuring performance. Choosing reliable, specific, valid, reproducible, and interpretable quality indicators will help insure successful implementation and desired improvements in care. Under the 2008 Conditions for Coverage, dialysis facilities are required to have a Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement (QAPI) program.</p>
<p>With these factors in mind, potential quality indicators derived from this Guideline are suggested below to assist local facilities in their QAPI efforts. Depending upon current local practices and available resources, individual facilities are encouraged to consider selecting one or more of the following areas for QAPI activities:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Increase number of patients with advance care plans in place. </li>
    <li>Increase number of patients who have a designated legal decision-maker in the event of incapacity. </li>
    <li>Decrease number of patients reporting pain. </li>
    <li>Increase number of patients with symptom assessments done. </li>
    <li>Increase number of patients for whom nephrology clinicians have answered the &quot;surprise&quot; question. </li>
    <li>Increase number of terminally ill patients who are referred to hospice. </li>
</ul>
<p>Suggestions and examples of some tools (e.g., methods for assessing decision-making capacity) that might be used to implement these recommendations are provided in the Toolkit in the full version of the current guideline (see also &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot;).</p></div>"/>
