	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><strong>The following recommendations and conclusions are based on good or consistent scientific evidence (Level A)</strong>:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Systemic hormone therapy (HT) with estrogen alone or in combination with progestin, is the most effective therapy for vasomotor symptoms related to menopause. </li>
    <li>Low-dose and ultra-low systemic doses of estrogen are associated with a better adverse effect profile than standard doses and may reduce vasomotor symptoms in some women. </li>
    <li>Given the variable response to HT and the associated risks, it is recommended that health care providers individualize care and treat women with the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration that is needed to relieve vasomotor symptoms. </li>
    <li>The risks of combined systemic HT include thromboembolic disease and breast cancer. </li>
    <li>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRIs), clonidine, and the gabapentin are effective alternatives to HT for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms related to menopause. </li>
    <li>Estrogen therapy effectively alleviates atrophic vaginal symptoms related to menopause. Local therapy is advised for the treatment of women with only vaginal symptoms. </li>
    <li>Paroxetine is the only nonhormonal therapy that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms. </li>
    <li>The FDA approved ospemifene for treating moderate-to-severe dyspareunia in postmenopausal women. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The following conclusions are based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence (Level B)</strong>:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Data do not support the use of progestin-only medications, testosterone, or compounded bioidentical hormones for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms. </li>
    <li>Data do not show that phytoestrogens, herbal supplements, and lifestyle modifications are efficacious for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms. </li>
    <li>Nonestrogen water-based or silicone-based vaginal lubricants and moisturizers may alleviate vaginal symptoms related to menopause. </li>
    <li>Common sense lifestyle solutions such as layering of clothing, maintaining a lower ambient temperature, and consuming cool drinks are reasonable measures for the management of vasomotor symptoms. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The following recommendation is based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (Level C)</strong>:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The decision to continue HT should be individualized and be based on a woman's symptoms and the risk&amp;ndash;benefit ratio, regardless of age. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Definitions</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong>Grades of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>I</strong>: Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized controlled trial.</p>
<p><strong>II-1</strong>: Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without randomization.</p>
<p><strong>II-2</strong>: Evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case&amp;ndash;control analytic studies, preferably from more than one center or research group.</p>
<p><strong>II-3</strong>: Evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments also could be regarded as this type of evidence.</p>
<p><strong>III</strong>: Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees.</p>
<p><strong>Levels of Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> &amp;mdash; Recommendations are based on good and consistent scientific evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> &amp;mdash; Recommendations are based on limited or in consistent scientific evidence.</p>

    <li>Although HT is well tolerated by most women, standard doses may cause adverse effects, such as breast tenderness, vaginal bleeding, bloating, and headaches. </li>
    <li>The risks of systemic combined HT include thromboembolic disease and breast cancer. The majority of trials that analyzed the safety of HT have assessed preparations containing conjugated equine estrogen alone or in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study, a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) of healthy menopausal women aged 50 to 77 years, demonstrated a slightly increased risk of breast cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, and venous thromboembolic events and a decreased risk of fractures and colon cancer after an average of 5 years of combined HT. Among women receiving estrogen only, there was an increased risk of thromboembolic events, but not an increased risk of cardiovascular events or breast cancer. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Clonidine</strong></p>
<p>Common adverse effects reported were dry mouth, insomnia, and drowsiness.</p>
<p><strong>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Selective Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SSNRIs)</strong></p>
<p>Reported adverse effects included nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, nervousness, constipation, somnolence, sweating, and sexual dysfunction, but these generally resolved with time or dose adjustment.</p>
<p><strong>Gabapentin</strong></p>
<p>Common adverse effects from gabapentin include dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema.</p>
<p><strong>Estrogen Agonists and Estrogen Antagonists</strong></p>
<p>Common adverse effects of ospemifene reported during clinical trials included hot flushes, vaginal discharge, muscle spasms, genital discharge, and excessive sweating.</p></div>"/>
