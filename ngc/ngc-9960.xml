	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Health professionals should have an understanding of the terms by which First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis identify themselves. (<strong>III-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Health professionals should have an understanding of the terms &quot;cultural awareness,&quot; &quot;cultural competence,&quot; &quot;cultural safety,&quot; and &quot;cultural humility.&quot; Health professionals should recognize that First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis may have different perspectives about what culturally safe care is and should seek guidance on community-specific values.

</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Demographics</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary Statement</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Demographically, First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis peoples are younger and more mobile than non-Aboriginal people. This requires extra effort on the part of health care professionals to establish an environment of trust and cultural safety in their workplaces as the opportunity to provide care may be brief. (<strong>III</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;3&quot;>
    <li>Health professionals should be aware of the limitations of statistics collected with respect to First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis and should avoid making generalizations about mortality and morbidity risks when comparing First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis with one another and with non-Aboriginal populations. (<strong>III-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Health professionals who wish to conduct research with First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis must use recognized ethical frameworks that include the OCAP (ownership, control, access, and possession) principles, the Tri-Council Policy Statement, and community-specific guidelines. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Social Determinants of Health Among First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary Statements</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Canada ranks 6th in the world on the World Health Organization Human Development Index; however, the First Nations rank 68th. (<strong>II-3</strong>) </li>
    <li>There have been centuries of formal agreements between European governments and First Nations. They were initially conducted in the spirit of friendship and cooperation, but later became centred on land ownership and resource extraction. Since they have been repeatedly dishonoured, there is an environment of mistrust in First Nations towards governments, their representatives, their policies, and anyone perceived to have authority. (<strong>III</strong>) </li>
    <li>The <em>Indian Act</em> and its subsequent amendments were designed to control every aspect of a Status Indian's life and to promote assimilation. It was also a tool that the government used to access First Nations' land and resources. (<strong>III</strong>) </li>
    <li>The intergenerational trauma experienced by First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis is the product of colonialization. Residential schools, forced relocation, involuntary sterilization, forced adoption, religious conversion, and enfranchisement are a few examples of government policy towards First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis that have created intergenerational posttraumatic stress and dysfunction. However, they continue to be a resilient people. (<strong>III</strong>) </li>
    <li>Most Canadians are unaware that a large proportion of Canada's gross domestic product is funded by monies garnished from natural resources extracted from Aboriginal lands, while First Nations and Inuit communities rely on insufficient money transfers from the Federal government. (<strong>III</strong>) </li>
    <li>Multinational companies extract resources from lands that are often on or adjacent to Aboriginal communities, or lands that are under land claims negotiations. The management of lands and resources by the provinces in some regions and by the territorial and federal governments in other regions has made it difficult for First Nations Inuit and M&amp;eacute;tis communities to communicate with multinational corporations, especially where land claim negotiations are ongoing or nonexistent. Multinational corporations do not provide revenues to these communities. Most Aboriginal communities are impoverished without adequate public health infrastructure, and without economic capital to improve their condition. (<strong>III</strong>) </li>
    <li>Jurisdictional issues today make it difficult to provide health care, take care of the land, and promote healthy communities. (<strong>III</strong>) </li>
    <li>Eating traditional country foods helps to preserve cultural identity, but increasing environmental contaminants such as lead, arsenic, mercury, and persistent organic pollutants may compromise food safety. (<strong>II-3</strong>) </li>
    <li>Given demographic shifts such as rapidly growing populations with large youth cohorts and the increasing urbanization of First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis in Canada, it is an important reality that most clinicians will encounter First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis in their practice. (<strong>II-3</strong>) </li>
    <li>Traditionally, men and women in First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis cultures enjoyed equal and complimentary roles. Colonialization generally led to First Nations and Inuit women being objectified, disrespected, and ignored. Through specific pieces of legislation, First Nations women in particular lost their voices and powers within their communities, including their role in promoting traditional health and education. (<strong>III</strong>) </li>
    <li>The unemployment rate is much higher in Aboriginal communities than in those of non-Aboriginal Canadians. This is a major contributor to the gaps in socioeconomic status and access to equitable and quality health care. (<strong>II-3</strong>) </li>
    <li>The language of health outcome measurement often perpetuates negative stereotypes towards First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis because outcomes are reported out of the context of the social, political, and economic circumstances. (<strong>III</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;5&quot;>
    <li>Health professionals should recognize the intergenerational impact of residential schools as one of the root causes of the health and social inequities among First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis, with important implications for their experiences and practices surrounding pregnancy and parenting. (<strong>II-3A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Health professionals should be aware that the discourse on health care policy and land claim negotiations often perpetuates negative stereotypes and often occurs without accurate reference to colonialization. (<strong>III-L</strong>) </li>

                <li>Recognize that many First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis women, families, and communities have had significantly negative experiences with child protection and social services personnel, and that it can have a profound effect on their interaction with the health care system. </li>
                <li>Arctic char and caribou carry low levels of contaminants, and pregnant and lactating women are actively encouraged to consume these foods. </li>

<p><strong>Summary Statement</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Jurisdictional conflicts between federal, provincial, territorial, and band governments make it difficult to provide comprehensive public health and health services to First Nations. (<strong>III</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;7&quot;>
    <li>Health professionals should be aware of ongoing debates regarding jurisdictional responsibilities that impede access to good quality, timely, and culturally safe health care for First Nations and Inuit, and of Jordan's Principle. Jordan's Principle calls on the government agency of first contact to ensure that children get necessary and timely care by paying for services immediately and seeking reimbursement from the appropriate agency later. (<strong>III-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Health professionals who provide care to First Nations and Inuit should be aware of the Non-Insured Health Benefits program, its eligibility and coverage requirements, and the exceptions and special permissions needed in some cases. Health professionals should recognize that they have a vital role in advocating for their First Nations and Inuit patients and assisting with obtaining these benefits. Health professionals should be aware that M&amp;eacute;tis do not have access to Non-Insured Health Benefits and may face unique challenges accessing health care. (<strong>III-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>All health professionals should acknowledge and respect the role that Aboriginal and Traditional midwives have in promoting the sexual and reproductive health of women and should be aware that this role is not limited to pregnancy and delivery, but often extends beyond the birth year. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Health professionals should inquire about their patients' use of traditional medicines and practices as part of routine health practices, including prenatal care. (<strong>III-A</strong>) </li>

<p><strong>Summary Statement</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The harmony of First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis societies was disrupted by European colonialization at the end of the 18th century, causing widespread effects on the sexual health of First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis women and men. (<strong>III</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;12&quot;>
    <li>Health professionals should be aware of <em>Canadian Criminal Code</em> laws governing sexual activities in minors, including those under age 12, those between 12 and 16 years old, and those with a much older partner. (<strong>III-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Given the prevalence of sexual abuse and exploitation, health professionals must address the possibility of sexual abuse or exploitation once a trusting relationship has been established. All gynaecologic and obstetric examinations must be approached sensitively, allowing the patient to determine when she feels comfortable enough to proceed. (<strong>III-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Health professionals should be aware of the increased prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus/ acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) among First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis and should offer HIV counselling and screening to women who are pregnant or of childbearing age. Culturally safe approaches to HIV and other hematogenously transferred disease counselling, testing, diagnosis, and treatment should be supported and adopted. (<strong>III-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Health professionals should be aware of the high rates of cervical cancer and poorer outcomes once diagnosed for First Nations and Inuit patients. Health professionals should strive to limit the disparity between their Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients by promoting culturally safe screening options. (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Health professionals must ensure that First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis women have access to services for all their reproductive health needs, including terminations, without prejudice. Health professionals should strive to ensure confidentiality, particularly in small and fly-in communities. (<strong>III-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Health professionals should recognize pregnancy as a unique opportunity to engage with and affirm the sexual and reproductive health rights, values, and beliefs of First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis women. (<strong>III-L</strong>) </li>

                <li>Truly understanding the personal context of your First Nations, Inuit, or M&amp;eacute;tis patients, and acquiring their trust takes time; however, it will allow you to provide them with optimal human papilloma virus (HPV) and cervical cancer preventive care that is responsive to their specific needs. </li>
                <li>If a woman is using metformin to regulate her blood sugars, make sure she is aware that ovulation may occur and she could become pregnant. A method of birth control suitable for the individual, taking into consideration her health issues, would need to be selected. </li>
                <li>Recognize that some women choose a termination largely out of fear that if carried to term, her child will be taken into care. With the intention of supporting a culturally safe experience that respects a woman's self-determination, health professionals should be careful to inquire about the context surrounding the choice to terminate, as well as the desire to observe a specific ceremony or protocol upon termination. For women who would choose to terminate out of fear that their child would be taken away, health professionals should work with social services and advocate for access to resources that support the woman's choice. </li>

<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;18&quot;>
    <li>Health care providers should ask about, respect, and advocate for institutional protocols and policies supporting the wishes of individuals and families regarding disposal or preservation of tissues involved in conception, pregnancy, miscarriages, terminations, hysterectomy, and other procedures. (<strong>III-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Health professionals should recognize that mental illnesses such as mood disorders, anxiety, and addictions are a major public health issue for many First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis. (<strong>II-3B</strong>) Use of mood-altering substances that lead to addiction is often a mechanism for coping with the pain of their intergenerational trauma. Health professionals should familiarize themselves with culturally safe harm reduction strategies that can be used to support First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis women and their families struggling with substance dependence. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Health professionals should support and promote the return of birth to rural and remote communities for women at low risk of complications. The necessary involvement of community in decision-making around the distribution and allocation of resources for maternity care should be acknowledged and facilitated. (<strong>III-A</strong>) </li>

            <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
                <li>It is important to many First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis women to have family members present when seeing a health professional. The presence of family members at a birth is an important way many First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis communities are &quot;reclaiming birth&quot; for their healing. Ensure that there is adequate space and chairs so that everyone can be seated at the same level, including the health professional. </li>
                <li>Instruct staff to inquire about best appointment times rather than assigning them. Be aware of a patient's travel context in terms of distance, financial constraints, child care challenges, etc. If you are receiving patients from the North, be aware of flight schedules and travel time and schedule your appointments accordingly. </li>
                <li>Use your prenatal sheet: the checklist on your prenatal sheet can help you identify barriers and challenges to a healthy pregnancy and inquire about the patient's socioeconomic situation in a sensitive manner. Go through the sheet one question at a time, ask follow-up questions sensitively, and allow time for your patient to respond. </li>
                <li>Ask your patient about her support networks and if there are other agencies involved in her care, such as mental health or social services. </li>
                <li>For many First Nations communities, tobacco has a sacred role in healing and ceremonies. Being culturally safe includes respecting this sacred role and clearly distinguishing between smoking and ceremonial tobacco use. </li>
                <li>Communication and collaboration is important. Engage with others in your community of practice to ensure continuity of culturally safe care, including within intervention chains, should they be needed. </li>
                <li>Know your local social service resources, personnel, and their contact information, and establish a collaborative rapport with them. Encourage your local social services to connect with you on an ongoing basis so that you can strengthen efforts made to achieve positive outcomes. </li>
                <li>Be aware of and educate staff about patterns of automatic referral and understand that flags are flexible. When appropriate, work collaboratively with medical and social services to implement preventative care and support your patient and her family in improving outcomes. </li>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Mature Women&amp;rsquo;s Health</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;21&quot;>
    <li>Health professionals should be aware that there is a great lack of research, resources, and programming about mature women's health issues, including menopause, that is specific to First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis. Health professionals should advocate for further research in this area. (<strong>III-A</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Changing Outcomes Through Culturally Competent Care</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary Statements</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Research has shown that where cultural competency strategies have been implemented, health outcomes and patient satisfaction have improved. (<strong>II-3</strong>) </li>
    <li>Subtle racism may occur without conscious intent, and is therefore best defined and identified by those who experience it. (<strong>III</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;22&quot;>
    <li>Health professionals should seek guidance about culturally specific communication practices and should tailor communications to the specific situations and histories of their patients. (<strong>III-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Health professionals may express to their patients that they wish to establish a respectful rapport through listening, acknowledging differences, and encouraging feedback. (<strong>III-L</strong>) </li>
    <li>First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis should receive care in their own language, where possible. Health care programs and institutions providing service to significant numbers of First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis should have interpreters and First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis health advocates on staff.

            <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
                <li>Understand that there can be large cultural variations between patients. Get to know your First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis patients individually and do not make assumptions. </li>
                <li>Schedule longer appointment times. Investing more time from the beginning helps establish a more effective and respectful rapport. Health professionals should be aware that the health narrative begins with the context and ends with the individual. This is rooted in language as well as in the value of humility, and it requires professionals to be skilled in active listening. Health professionals should appreciate that adapting their practices will actually save time in the long run and that giving the patient more time is an investment in the care. Recognize that when patients are not listened to, it is a continuation of the oppression. </li>
                <li>Try to familiarize yourself a bit with the culture so you can get a sense of a woman's expectations and preferences about medical examinations and health practitioner&amp;ndash;patient interactions. </li>
                <li>Verify your patient's understanding of your recommendations. Do not assume that they understand what you are asking them to do or how to do it. For example, they may not know where to go to get a blood sample taken. </li>
                <li>Rather than viewing the individual and the culture as barriers to the delivery of care, it is better to consider how our beliefs and values as health care providers, and the system in which we practise, has created challenges for First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis health and well-being. </li>
                <li>For many First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis a positive experience from first entering the clinic or hospital is critical to feeling welcome and safe. Educate front-line staff, including front desk staff, on key principles of cultural safety. Greet all patients in a respectful, warm manner, even if they are late, and train staff to do the same: doing so will help ensure that the first interaction with a patient is a safe one. Be aware of policies or common practices that may be discriminatory, for example policies or routine practices of automatic drug screening upon presentation for labour and delivery. </li>
                <li>Being able to provide culturally safe care involves a learning process. It takes time to build and refine effective relationships with First Nations, Inuit, and M&amp;eacute;tis. Patience, compassion, curiosity, and genuine interest are needed. </li>
