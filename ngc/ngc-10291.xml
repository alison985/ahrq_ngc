	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The grading of evidence (<strong>High, Moderate, Low, Very Low</strong>) and strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong</strong> or <strong>Conditional</strong>) are defined at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Presentation and Detection of Heart Failure (HF) in Children</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Symptom Severity and Recognition</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>The New York Heart Association (NYHA)/Ross classiﬁcation is a suitable basis for symptom stratiﬁcation of patients with established chronic HF, but is not essential to establishing the diagnosis, or determining the prognosis of HF in children (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Values and preferences</em>. This Recommendation places high value on the need for the development of reliable and valid prognostic indicators for pediatric HF.</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;2&quot;>
    <li>Underlying cardiac disease should be considered and excluded in younger infants with feeding difﬁculties and growth failure when primary gastrointestinal and other common causes have been ruled out, and in infants, toddlers, and children with chronic calorie, protein, or trace element deﬁciency (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Values and preferences</em>. This Recommendation places a high value on early diagnosis of underlying HF in situations of ambiguous clinical symptoms and signs, or when uncertainty is present. Early and repeated cardiovascular examination of infants is mandated as the most valuable screening tool available. Expert evaluation is considered preferable in situations of uncertainty, notwithstanding the potential for unnecessary referral: the trade-off of missed diagnosis at an earlier stage of disease being of such signiﬁcant consequence to the patient and family.</p>
<p><strong>Presentation of Cardiomyopathies (CMs) in Children/Myocarditis in Children</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;3&quot;>
    <li>A high index of suspicion for CMs with acute decompensated HF is necessary in emergency and primary care settings, when evaluating infants with weakness, lethargy, abdominal pain, unexplained or disproportionate tachycardia, and tachypnea (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>In suspected muscular dystrophies, symptoms and signs of congestive HF might be concealed because of reduced physical activity. Careful evaluation of myocardial function (via serial echocardiography or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) beginning in mid-childhood is recommended (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Myocarditis should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of children who present with a viral prodrome and nonspeciﬁc respiratory or abdominal symptoms associated with tachycardia, hypotension, or cardiac rhythm abnormalities, even in the absence of cardiomegaly on chest x-ray (CXR) (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Values and preferences</em>. These Recommendations place a high value on a comprehensive approach to history-taking, examination, and differential diagnosis for children with suspected genetic or acquired CM and on a comprehensive approach to ongoing evaluation in suspected cases.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Diagnosis of HF in Children</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Chest Radiography</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Chest radiography is indicated as a ﬁrst-line investigation in children with suspected HF (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Biochemical and Routine Laboratory Testing</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;2&quot;>
    <li>Assessment of electrolytes (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>), glucose, acid-base status, urea and creatinine, hepatic transaminases, thyroid hormone levels, and a complete blood count should be performed at initial presentation of HF and repeated as needed to assess ongoing clinical status (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Electrocardiography</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;3&quot;>
    <li>All patients should have 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) performed at the time of presentation with HF, to exclude features of congenital or ischemic heart disease, arrhythmia and pre-excitation (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Holter/ambulatory ECG monitoring is not indicated as a primary diagnostic test in HF, unless hypertrophic CM (HCM), arrhythmogenic right ventricular (RV) CM, or tachycardia-induced CM is the suspected cause (<strong>Conditional Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Holter/ambulatory ECG monitoring might be indicated during chronic follow-up, particularly in higher arrhythmia risk groups, including patients with primary restrictive CM or HCM, with tachycardia-induced CM, or those who are taking anti-arrhythmic therapy (<strong>Conditional Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Echocardiography</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;6&quot;>
    <li>All patients with symptoms consistent with HF should undergo transthoracic echocardiography in a pediatric cardiology facility at, or as soon as possible after, initial presentation. This initial echocardiographic study should include as a minimum (<strong>Strong Recommendation, High-Quality Evidence</strong>):
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Ruling out congenital heart disease (with attention to coronary arteries) </li>
        <li>Assessment of myocardial appearance for phenotypic patterns of CM </li>
        <li>Assessment of the systolic function parameters of the left ventricle by determining the shortening fraction (SF) and/or ejection fraction (EF) </li>
        <li>Measurement of the left ventricular (LV) end diastolic dimension Z-score </li>
        <li>Determination of the presence of mitral regurgitation </li>
        <li>Quantitative or qualitative assessment of RV function and RV pressure </li>
        <li>Assessment of LV diastolic function </li>
        <li>Exclusion of intracardiac thrombus </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Populations at increased risk for ventricular dysfunction should undergo routine periodic screening echocardiography even in the absence of cardiac symptoms (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>All patients with HF should undergo periodic follow-up echocardiography to reassess ventricular function with respect to response to medical therapy and to assess further progression of ventricular dysfunction. Follow-up echocardiography should also be repeated if there is a signiﬁcant change in the clinical status of the patient, either in terms of improvement or deterioration (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Values and preferences</em>. These Recommendations place a high value on the diagnostic accuracy of expert pediatric echocardiography done in a qualiﬁed facility, for primary evaluation and for follow-up assessment of at risk or affected patients. The trade-off of inconvenient access to such a facility is considered acceptable considering the beneﬁts of early accurate diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong>Biomarkers</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;9&quot;>
    <li>Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels are useful in distinguishing HF from respiratory or other non-cardiac disease and should be used as a conﬁrmatory test in the acute evaluation of pediatric HF (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Metabolic and Genetic Testing</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;10&quot;>
    <li>All pediatric patients presenting with HF require a thorough personal health history and a family history including a 3-generation pedigree (<strong>Strong Recommendation, High-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Metabolic laboratory testing in children with unexplained CM (of hypertrophic, dilated, or non-compaction phenotype) should be based on clinical presentation and assisted by specialist consultation: virtually all undiagnosed patients, whether there is a familial pattern or not, require primary screening tests, including serum amino acids, organic acids, total and free carnitine levels, lactate, and urine testing for ketones, mucopolysaccharides, and oligosaccharides (<strong>Strong Recommendation, High- Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Specialty consultation with genetic and/or metabolic services is recommended to guide further testing such as muscle biopsy or speciﬁc gene screening, molecular, or cytogenetic testing. Excluding familial CM is crucial, especially when the presentation is in the fetus or newborn (<strong>Strong Recommendation, High-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>At-risk family members might require secondary diagnostic screening, including genetic testing, echocardiography, or other relevant modalities of screening, depending on the etiology identiﬁed (<strong>Conditional Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Endomyocardial Biopsy for Acute Myocarditis</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;14&quot;>
    <li>A diagnosis of acute myocarditis should be considered in all children, regardless of age, who present with new onset HF without a history of decreased functional capacity, and speciﬁcally if echocardiographic ventricular dilation is less than expected for the degree of systolic dysfunction and clinical severity (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) should only be performed if conﬁrming the clinical diagnosis of myocarditis will have a clear effect on the patient treatment plan (for example, listing for transplantation). EMB is not recommended in infants weighing less than 10 kg, or in patients who are hemodynamically unstable (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidenc</strong>e). </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Values and Preferences</em>. These Recommendations place a higher emphasis on clinical diagnosis supported by noninvasive imaging, and a lower emphasis on conﬁrmation via biopsy, except in speciﬁc cases as outlined in this Recommendation. The trade-off is diagnostic conﬁrmation for increased safety.</p>
<p><strong>Cardiac MRI</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;16&quot;>
    <li>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) might assist in the clinical diagnosis of myocarditis, and might provide additional information in CMs by tissue and scar characterization. The prognostic value of CMRI ﬁndings is not yet known (<strong>Conditional Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Medical Treatment of the Child with Acute HF</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Acute Therapy for HF</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>A loop diuretic, such as furosemide, is recommended for patients with HF and signs and symptoms of congestion. An initial starting dose of 0.5-1 mg/kg intravenously or orally every 6-12 hours is safe and effective (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Children presenting with HF because of reduced cardiac output with end-organ dysfunction are likely to beneﬁt from inotropic therapy as a rescue strategy. In this setting, milrinone, dobutamine, and low dose epinephrine have all shown efﬁcacy in children (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Inotropic therapy should be conﬁned to patients with depressed systolic function and clinical evidence of low cardiac output syndrome who can be closely monitored for tachyarrhythmias and blood pressure lability (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Values and preferences</em>. These Recommendations place a high priority on improving cardiac output in an emergency setting, and acknowledge the deleterious effect of sustained inotropic stimulation on myocardial survival.</p>
<p><strong>Chronic Therapy for HF: Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor and Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker Therapy</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;4&quot;>
    <li>The use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) therapy is indicated in children with HF because of primary heart muscle disease of the systemic left ventricle (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Values and preferences</em>. The Recommendation favors commitment to a course of medical therapy, which, although of uncertain duration, is associated with symptom improvement, and possibly with survival beneﬁt in certain patient groups.</p>
<p><strong>&amp;beta;-Adrenergic Antagonists</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;5&quot;>
    <li>Treatment with a &amp;beta;-adrenergic antagonist such as carvedilol, metoprolol, or bisoprolol might be initiated in the treatment of moderate to severe systolic dysfunction of a systemic left ventricle (<strong>Conditional Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Values and preferences</em>. This Recommendation is based on the premise that patients are willing to accept a relatively low rate of side effects for potential clinical beneﬁts in the absence of conclusive evidence for beneﬁt.</p>
<p><strong>Aldosterone Antagonist Therapy</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;6&quot;>
    <li>Aldosterone antagonist therapy is reasonable in children with chronic systolic HF, provided renal function is normal or only mildly impaired. Close monitoring of renal function and serum potassium is required when co-administering aldosterone antagonist therapy with ACEi therapy <strong>(Conditional Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Medical Management of Myocarditis</strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;7&quot;>
    <li>A standard approach to HF management should be applied in patients with myocarditis including inotropic support and diuretic therapy (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>For fulminant myocarditis, mechanical circulatory support should be considered. Invasive therapies are considered acceptable considering the prospect of spontaneous recovery (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Corticosteroids are not recommended as a routine treatment for myocarditis, particularly in the absence of robust randomized controlled trial evidence. Continued speculative use of immunosuppressive therapy in the absence of a prospective clinical trial will not contribute to the evidence base of management for this disorder (<strong>Conditional Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) is not recommended as a routine treatment for myocarditis (<strong>Conditional Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Values and preferences</em>. These Recommendations place a high priority on conservative management in an observed and monitored hospital setting when this disease is in evolution.</p>

<p>Searches in Ovid MEDLINE and Ovid EMBASE were performed using database subject headings and, when appropriate text words, to create a base set of references on the topic of heart failure in the context of congenital heart disease or cardiomyopathy, excluding heart assist devices, heart transplants, case reports or reviews, and limited to English, ages 18 and under, and the publication years 1982 to April 2012. The base set was combined with concepts for symptoms, diagnosis, treatments and quality of life. Four additional searches were conducted for heart failure and symptoms, heart failure and beta blockers, myocarditis and (gamma globulin or corticosteroids or interferon or immunosuppression or steroids), and cardiomyopathies and (supplements or co-factors).</p>
<p>The literature searches resulted in 2716 unique citations, acquired in three separate searches. These were clustered into 3 datasets, and each abstract was reviewed separately by the three primary authors of this manuscript. Of these 615 were deemed appropriate for complete review based on relevance, and specific criteria established prospectively.</p>
<p>The 615 manuscripts were distributed to three working groups, dealing with the three topic areas. Each working group comprised 6 primary and a variable number of secondary panelists. Of the 615 identified by abstract review, only 260 were deemed of sufficient quality or relevance to merit formal review using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method.</p>

    <li>Hyperkalemia might result in patients who receive spironolactone and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, especially if renal function is already compromised. Therefore, potassium levels and renal function indices should be checked before starting spironolactone, within 7-14 days after introduction, and periodically thereafter. Any potassium supplementation should be carefully re-evaluated. Male gynaecomastia is a nonreversible complication of spironolactone, and must be closely monitored. </li>
    <li>Caution is advised when angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) are used in the first 4 months of life, because renal dysfunction is more common, and therefore uptitration must be carefully monitored. A small drop in systolic blood pressure is typically noted in patients who take an ACEi. This might occasionally exceed the expected 5%-10% drop in baseline values, necessitating observation for up to 2 hours after the first dose. </li>
    <li>There is a low rate of side effects with &amp;beta;-adrenergic antagonist therapy. </li>
    <li>The diagnostic accuracy of right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy for suspected myocarditis tends to be low, and is affected by the length of time from presentation of symptoms to time of biopsy, variation in pathological interpretation, and sampling errors. The addition of left ventricular biopsy or magnetic resonance imaging-guided biopsy might increase yield, but also the hazards of the procedure. Endomyocardial biopsy is associated with an increased risk of adverse events in children with suspected myocarditis who are using inotropic support. </li>
    <li>The goal of inotropic agent therapy needs to be carefully considered: although there is good empirical evidence that inotropes can bridge patients to mechanical circulatory support or cardiac transplantation, their toxicities prohibit routine use and limit their utility to only the sickest patients, who genuinely require rescue from low cardiac output with organ dysfunction with metabolic acidosis. The requirement for inotropic support for more than 48 hours requires a plan for weaning of support, transition to a more viable means of circulatory support, and consideration of the need for cardiac transplantation. </li>
    <li>Milrinone might cause peripheral dilation and should be used with caution in hypotensive patients. </li>
    <li>Prolonged administration (&amp;gt;72 hours) of nitroprusside sodium, especially when associated with renal failure, can result in thiocyanate toxicity. </li>

These Recommendations are aimed to provide a reasonable and practical approach to care for specialists and allied health professionals obliged with the duty of bestowing optimal care to patients and families, and can be subject to change as scientific knowledge and technology advance and as practice patterns evolve. The statement is not intended to be a substitute for physicians using their individual judgment in managing clinical care in consultation with the patient, with appropriate regard to all the individual circumstances of the patient, diagnostic and treatment options available and available resources. Adherence to these Recommendations will not necessarily produce successful outcomes in every case. </li>

    <li>This document is intended to enhance, but not replace, expert physician judgment in individual scenarios. Finally, the authors acknowledge that the content of these guidelines reﬂects a literature and clinical experience that borrows much from that of adult medicine.
