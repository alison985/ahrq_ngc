	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Work-relatedness usually involves high force, extreme posture work (e.g., meat cutting, roofing); rarely is low force, repetitive work a cause. </li>
    <li>Typical presentation of median nerve entrapment is burning pain on thenar side, especially after work and at night. Hand diagram is more useful than provocative tests. </li>
    <li>Electrodiagnostic studies (EDS) are necessary for diagnostic certainty, carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) surgery requests, or when time loss (TL) exceeds 2 weeks. </li>
    <li>Conservative treatment may be warranted if substantial symptomatic and functional progress is evident. Surgical release of median nerve entrapment is typically more effective than conservative measures. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Work-Related Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>Work-related CTS is associated with significant preventable disability. Accurate, timely diagnosis and establishment of work-relatedness is critical to prevent delays and ensure optimal outcomes. EDS showing delayed median nerve conduction velocity (NCV) across the carpal tunnel provides definitive diagnosis. Some clinical tests correlate with EDS. Between 30% and 70% of CTS patients may fully recover with certain conservative interventions within a few weeks to a few months. However, 90% of CTS patients fully recover within a few weeks after surgical release of the carpal tunnel. Response to either intervention may be better when care begins early. Due to high success and low risk associated with carpal tunnel surgery, a failure to obtain timely improvement in symptoms and function from a conservative trial warrants timely consideration of specialist referral.</p>
<p><strong>Case Definition</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Clinical presentation of median nerve entrapment (thenar pain/paresthesia, often after work and at night) </li>
    <li>Work place exposure to known CTS inducing activities </li>
    <li>Corroboration of diagnosis by EDS (the latter is most important when response to conservative care is delayed, TL exceeds 2 weeks, and/or CTS release surgery is being considered/authorized) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Evaluation Summary</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Rule-in median nerve entrapment initially with validated clinical methods (symptoms, work exposure, motor function, provocative testing). </li>
    <li>Monitor symptoms, motor function, provocability, and work status to document improvement. </li>
    <li>Make an early referral for EDS and/or specialist consult if: a) symptomatic for over 6-12 months prior to claim acceptance, as conservative care is less likely to benefit; b) time-loss exceeds 2 weeks; or c) significant improvement, including ability to work is not attained within the first several weeks of conservative care. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Intervention Summary</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Nocturnal wrist splinting with daytime use as needed to control symptoms when using hands. </li>
    <li>Improvement may be hastened with additional mobility interventions (e.g., wrist stretching exercises, wrist manipulation/mobilization). </li>
    <li>For diagnostic and surgical referral (particularly in underserved areas) consider assistance from a care coordinator, e.g., from a Center of Occupational Health and Education (COHE). </li>

<p><strong>Assessing Study Methodologic Quality</strong></p>
<p>Attributes of study methodology quality vary according to the clinical procedure (e.g., diagnostic, therapeutic intervention) looked at, and specific research questions being studied. The American Academy of Neurology's Clinical Practice Guideline Process Manual offers a comprehensive guide to systematic evidence review, quality attributes and consensus process that generally serves as the approach taken by Industrial Insurance Chiropractic Advisory Committee (IICAC).</p>
<p>General attributes identified when extracting evidence from studies include identification of population, the intervention and co-interventions and outcomes being addressed in each study. The clinical questions addressed such as diagnostic accuracy, therapeutic effectiveness, or causation are determined. Studies are extracted into evidence tables including quality attributes and/or ratings which are reviewed both by department staff and committee members (usually 2 per study).</p>
<p>Specific quality attributes include: Diagnostic Accuracy &amp;ndash; design, spectrum of patients, validity and relevance of outcome metric; Therapeutic Interventions &amp;ndash; comparison groups (no treatment, placebo, comparative intervention), treatment allocation, blinding/masking (method and degree: single, double, independent), follow-up (period and completion), and analysis (statistical power, intent-to-treat). Specific attention is paid to several factors including reporting of outcomes (primary vs. secondary), relevance of outcome (e.g., function versus pain), and meaningfulness (clinically important change versus minimally detectable change).</p>
<p><strong>Synthesizing Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Consideration of study quality (class), significance (statistical precision), consistency across studies, magnitude of effect, and relevance to populations and procedures were taken into account in preparing draft summaries. Special attention was given to clarifying conclusions related to the clinical questions of interest. Evidence, particularly with low tech and highly diffused examination and conservative procedures addressed here, is rarely truly &quot;definitive,&quot; even when multiple studies exist. Inconsistent conclusions typically reflect error (systematic, random) and/or bias in studies. Data pooling via meta-analysis is useful to reduce random error when studies are of sufficient power and methodologic strength. Larger meaningful effect size may increases confidence in findings.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The conservative care resource/guideline process can be described in the following steps:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Once a topic for a resource/guideline is selected, a subcommittee of the Industrial Insurance Chiropractic Advisory Committee (IICAC) made up of regular members identifies additional content experts to join the subcommittee and/or serve as consultants. Various clinical specialists may provide specific input or be invited to give a presentation to the subcommittee. </li>
    <li>A systematic review and summary of the relevant peer-reviewed clinical and scientific literature is done (primarily by department staff and subcommittee members with specific interest and/or expertise in a topic). Claim and billing data from Labor &amp;amp; Industries may also be reviewed. </li>
    <li>Literature is retrieved, assessed for quality and summarized in evidence tables which are presented to the subcommittee for review. Then at a variable series of group meetings and phone conferences, the evidence with greatest relevance to the resource/guideline topic is highlighted. </li>
    <li>Based on this literature review and assessment by the subcommittee, department staff typically develop an initial draft resource guideline generally organized as follows:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>General summary of topic, case definition, clinical evaluation, interventions, and clinical progress </li>
        <li>Checklist for general chronological management with expected clinical and progress thresholds </li>
        <li>Readily usable functional progress instruments for a given condition </li>
        <li>Evidence summaries for clinical assessment (e.g., history, examination, imaging and special studies, prognostic and management issues, workers' compensation issues) </li>
        <li>Evidence summaries for conservative interventions (e.g., physiotherapeutic modalities, bracing, manipulation and mobilization, soft tissue techniques, exercise and rehabilitation approaches, special interventions, common medications [injected and oral]), and workers compensation specific interventions (e.g., ergonomic interventions) </li>
        <li>Additional materials (glossaries, procedure descriptions, instrument scoring) </li>
        <li>Evidence and methodology process used in development </li>
        <li>Citations </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Subcommittee members critique and revise the guideline based on what is most useful for the clinician in diagnosing and treating the condition in question. Additional expertise, consultation, and literature searches may also be added. This results in a second draft guideline that is then shared with the full advisory committee to obtain their input. At this stage specific content experts/reviewers may be sought as the subcommittee identifies particular issues. </li>

It did not differentiate between various physical approaches such as exercise and mobilization. The study matched patients based on available characteristics of age, gender, severity, nerve conduction velocity (NCV) findings, as well as administrative factors such as insurance coverage. A cost utility ratio was calculated for direct costs of therapy concluding that non-surgical care averaged about $300 more than surgical care. Surgery is more cost effective in the long term for treating carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) patients.</p></div>"/>
