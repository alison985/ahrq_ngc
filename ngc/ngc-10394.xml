<p>Clinicians should refer patients for supportive services as necessary to address modifiable barriers to adherence. An ongoing plan for coordination of care should be established.</p>
<p>Clinicians should involve patients in the decision-making process regarding initiation of ART. The patient should make the final decision of whether and when to initiate ART.</p>
<p>When the decision to initiate treatment is made, ART should be prescribed and monitored by, or in consultation with, clinicians who have experience in managing ART.</p>

            To be successful over time, initiation of ART is a process that involves both the selection of the most appropriate regimen for the individual <em>and</em> its acceptance by the patient with education and adherence counseling. All are critical in achieving the goal of durable and complete viral suppression.<br />
            <br />
            The Clinical Education Initiative (CEI) Line provides primary care providers in New York State the opportunity to consult with clinicians who have experience managing ART. The CEI Line can be reached at 1-866-637-2342 or 1-585-273-2793.<br />

<p>See Appendix B in the original guideline document for a comparison of the recommendations on when to initiate ART from the New York State Department of Health AIDS Institute, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the International AIDS Society &amp;ndash; USA Panel.</p>
<p><strong>Counseling and Education Before Initiating ART</strong></p>
<p>Counseling and education should include the following:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Basic education about HIV, CD4 cells, viral load, and resistance </li>
    <li>Available treatment options and potential risks and benefits of therapy (see Table 4 in the original guideline document) </li>
    <li>The need for strict adherence to avoid the development of viral drug resistance (see &quot;The Importance of Patient Adherence&quot; below) </li>
    <li>Use of safer-sex practices and avoidance of needle-sharing activity, regardless of viral load, to prevent HIV transmission or superinfection </li>
</ul>
<p>Clinicians should involve the patient in the decision-making process regarding initiation of ART.</p>
<p><strong>Deferring ART</strong></p>
<p>Except in cases when initiation of treatment is urgent (see &quot;Initiating ART Following Acute Opportunistic Infections [OIs]&quot; below), clinicians should educate and prepare patients before initiating ART in those with potential barriers to adherence, including low health literacy; active alcohol or drug use; lack of insurance, transportation, or housing; depression; mistrust of medical providers; or a poor social support system.</p>
<p>In patients with advanced HIV (or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]), ART should be initiated even if barriers to adherence are present. In these cases, referrals to specialized adherence programs should be made for intensified adherence support (see Appendix D: New York State Adherence Services Contact List in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>Decisions to initiate ART in long-term nonprogressors and elite controllers should be individualized. (<strong>AIII</strong>)</p>

<p><strong>Initiating ART Following Acute Opportunistic Infections (OIs)</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should recommend that patients beginning treatment for acute opportunistic infections (OIs) initiate ART within 2 weeks (<em>see next recommendation for exceptions</em>). (<strong>AI</strong>)</p>
<p>Clinicians should not immediately initiate ART in patients with tuberculous meningitis or cryptococcal meningitis. Consultation with a clinician with experience in management of ART in the setting of acute OIs is recommended.</p>
<p>For all other manifestations of tuberculosis (TB), clinicians should initiate ART in HIV-infected patients as follows:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li><em>For patients with CD4 counts &amp;ge;50 cells/mm<sup>3</sup></em>: as soon as they are tolerating anti-TB therapy and no later than 8-12 weeks after initiating anti-TB therapy (<strong>AI</strong>) </li>
    <li><em>For patients with CD4 counts &amp;lt;50 cells/mm<sup>3</sup></em>: within 2 weeks of initiating anti-TB therapy (<strong>AI</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>The Importance of Patient Adherence</span></strong></p>
<p>A team approach to achieving adherence should be used. Nurses, pharmacists, peer counselors, caseworkers, and others who work in outreach, evaluation, and support of adherence should be involved. (<strong>III</strong>)</p>
<p>The clinician should assess treatment readiness prior to initiation of treatment, adherence readiness for subsequent regimens, and adherence at every clinical visit. (<strong>III</strong>)</p>
<p>Interventions should be intensified in times of decreased adherence.</p>
<p>Information about patients' beliefs and attitudes should be communicated with all members of the healthcare team so that each provider can consistently address treatment adherence issues within the context of the overall treatment plan. (<strong>II</strong>)</p>
<p>If the patient is not fully committed to adhering to therapy, treatment should be delayed, and the clinician should continue to work on abating the patient's concerns. Appropriate referrals should be provided for support groups, mental health, and drug treatment. (<strong>III</strong>)</p>
<p>Refer to the original guideline document for the list of potential barriers to adherence and strategies for promoting adherence.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Selecting an Initial Antiretroviral Regimen</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should obtain genotypic resistance testing at baseline and should consider repeating the test prior to initiating treatment in ART-na&amp;iuml;ve patients. (<strong>AIII</strong>)</p>
<p>Clinicians should involve their patients when deciding which antiretroviral regimen is most likely to result in adherence. (<strong>AIII</strong>)</p>
<p>For ART-na&amp;iuml;ve patients, the initial preferred antiretroviral regimen should include a combination of two nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) plus either a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or an integrase inhibitor. (<strong>AI</strong>)</p>
<p>For women considering pregnancy or not using effective contraception, efavirenz or combination pills containing efavirenz should be avoided. If there are no alternatives for efavirenz in women of childbearing potential, clinicians should strongly advise the use of effective contraception and should obtain a pregnancy test before initiating treatment. (<strong>AI</strong>)</p>
<p>Selection of antiretroviral agents should be individualized to address each patient's concurrent morbidities and medications, ability to adhere to complex regimens, and personal tolerance for adverse medication effects. (<strong>AIII</strong>)</p>
<p>Clinicians should follow up with patients by phone or visit within 2 weeks of initiating therapy to assess tolerance and adherence to the antiretroviral regimen. Adherence should be reinforced at regular intervals during the course of therapy. (<strong>AIII</strong>)</p>

<sup>a</sup>In pregnant women initiating therapy, the clinician may not have as much time to monitor for suboptimal suppression.<br />
<sup>b</sup>The cutoff will vary according to the manufacturer of the kit.</p>
<p><strong>Laboratory Monitoring of ART Side Effects</strong></p>
<p><em>Bone Marrow Suppression</em></p>
<p>Complete blood counts should be measured before initiation of ART and at least every 4 months thereafter. For patients at high risk for bone marrow toxicity (e.g., those with advanced HIV infection, those with pre-treatment cytopenias, or those who are receiving zidovudine), blood counts may have to be monitored more frequently because significant cytopenias may occur. (<strong>III</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Pancreatitis</em></p>
<p>When patients receiving ART present with signs and symptoms suggestive of pancreatitis, clinicians should obtain serum amylase and lipase levels. (<strong>III</strong>)</p>
<p>If signs or symptoms of pancreatitis occur in patients taking antiretroviral medications, the clinician should temporarily suspend the entire ART regimen. A new ART regimen may be initiated when enzymes are normalized but should not include antiretroviral medications that are most likely linked to pancreatitis, such as didanosine or stavudine.</p>
<p>An elevated serum amylase level should be confirmed with a serum lipase level. (<strong>III</strong>)</p>
<p>Clinicians should not prescribe didanosine for patients who have a history of pancreatitis. (<strong>III</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Lactic Acidosis/Hepatic Steatosis</em></p>
<p>When patients develop symptoms consistent with lactic acidosis syndrome in conjunction with an elevated lactate level (&amp;gt;2 mmol/L) and decreased serum bicarbonate (&amp;lt;20 mmol/L), the clinician should temporarily discontinue the entire ART regimen while an evaluation is conducted. (<strong>II</strong>)</p>
<p>Routine monitoring of serum lactate levels is not indicated in asymptomatic patients. (<strong>I</strong>)</p>
<p>Patients who are asymptomatic and have an unexplained decrease in serum bicarbonate level (&amp;lt;20 mmol/L) should be promptly re-evaluated with a repeat test and a venous or arterial lactate. (<strong>II</strong>) If a venous lactate is mildly elevated (2.1 to 5.0 mmol/L), an arterial lactate should be obtained, and reassessment for the presence of symptoms associated with lactic acidosis should be performed. (<strong>I</strong>) If the lactate is persistently elevated, the arterial pH is abnormal, or the patient has become symptomatic, ART should be discontinued. (<strong>III</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Hepatotoxicity</em></p>
<p>Clinicians should obtain serum liver enzyme levels at baseline and every 3 to 4 months thereafter in patients receiving ART. (<strong>III</strong>)</p>
<p>Clinicians should screen for alcohol use in patients with abnormal serum liver enzyme levels. (<strong>III</strong>)</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Use of Nevirapine</span></p>
<p>Clinicians should not use nevirapine as part of the initial regimen in women with CD4 counts &amp;gt;250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> or men with CD4 counts &amp;gt;400 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> because of an increased incidence of hepatotoxicity. (<strong>I</strong>)</p>
<p>When initiating an ART regimen that includes nevirapine, clinicians should obtain serum liver enzymes at baseline, at the time of dose escalation (14 days), and 2 weeks after dose escalation. (<strong>III</strong>)</p>
<p>Clinicians should counsel patients to seek medical evaluation when signs and symptoms of hepatitis, severe skin reactions, or hypersensitivity reactions related to nevirapine occur. Serum liver enzymes should be obtained whenever patients develop a rash during nevirapine therapy, particularly during the first 18 weeks of therapy. (<strong>II</strong>)</p>
<p>In the setting of hepatotoxicity related to nevirapine, patients should not be rechallenged with nevirapine. (<strong>I</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Renal Toxicity</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>For All HIV-infected Patients Receiving ART</span></p>
<p>Clinicians should routinely assess kidney function in all HIV-infected patients. A renal assessment should include:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Glomerular filtration rate estimated from serum creatinine (baseline and at least every 6 months) (<strong>AII</strong>) </li>
    <li>Blood urea nitrogen (baseline and at least every 6 months) (<strong>AIII</strong>) </li>
    <li>Urinalysis (baseline and at least annually) (<strong>AIII</strong>) </li>
    <li>For patients with diabetes and no known proteinuria: calculation of urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio to detect microalbuminuria (baseline and at least annually) (<strong>AI</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>For Patients Receiving Tenofovir</span></p>
<p>For patients initiating a tenofovir-containing regimen, clinicians should calculate glomerular filtration rates at initiation of therapy, 1 month after initiation of therapy, and then at least every 4 months thereafter.</p>
<p>Clinicians should adjust tenofovir dosing when glomerular filtration rate approaches 50 mL/min or discontinue tenofovir according to clinical status. (<strong>AII</strong>)</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>For Patients Receiving Indinavir</span></p>
<p>Clinicians should counsel patients receiving indinavir to drink at least 48 ounces of fluid per day.</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring for Allergic Reactions Associated with ART</strong></p>
<p>When patients receive any new antiretroviral drugs, clinicians should educate them about the possibility of ART-associated allergic reactions, including a hypersensitivity reaction, and the range of possible symptoms (see Table 9 in the original guideline document to view antiretroviral drugs associated with allergic reactions). (<strong>III</strong>)</p>
<p>Clinicians should discontinue offending drugs when there is a moderate to severe skin reaction, mucous membrane involvement, systemic toxicity, or fever. (<strong>I</strong>)</p>
<p>Clinicians should perform human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B*5701 testing before initiating abacavir-based therapy.</p>
<p>Clinicians should avoid re-challenging patients with a medication that has been associated with a hypersensitivity reaction, especially in the setting of abacavir reactions and severe NNRTI reactions. (<strong>I</strong>)</p>
<p>In patients who develop mild rash in response to nevirapine, clinicians should avoid escalating the nevirapine dose to twice daily until after the rash has resolved. For patients with moderate to severe cutaneous toxicity, nevirapine should be discontinued and should not be re-challenged. Use of an alternate NNRTI should be avoided. (<strong>III</strong>)</p>
<p>Prompt discontinuation of abacavir when a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected is necessary because symptoms will worsen over time. Once abacavir has been discontinued because of a possible or definite hypersensitivity reaction, abacavir should never be administered again. Re-challenge may result in an anaphylactic reaction with associated hypotension or death.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Changing a Successful Initial ART Regimen</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should change a successful initial ART regimen when the patient's adherence will be compromised by continuing the current regimen. (<strong>III</strong>)</p>
<p>When considering a change in the ART regime due to drug toxicity, the clinician should confirm that the viral load is maximally suppressed. (<strong>III</strong>) If maximal viral suppression has been achieved, the clinician should substitute the offending drug. (<strong>I</strong>)</p>
<p>The clinician should review results from previous resistance testing before changing a successful regimen. (<strong>III</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Failure to Achieve Goals of Initial ART</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should address adherence, obtain resistance assays, and consult with a provider with experience in HIV treatment before changing ART regimens that have failed.</p>
<p>Clinicians should not change an ART regimen when there is incomplete but significant viral suppression (&amp;ge;0.5 log reduction, or 3-fold, from baseline viral load value) compared with baseline and a more effective ART regimen cannot be constructed as a result of drug resistance or intolerance.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Second-Line Regimens and Salvage ART</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should consult with a provider with experience in HIV treatment when constructing a second-line regimen and salvage therapy regimens.</p>
<p>Clinicians should review individual antiretroviral history and results from HIV drug resistance testing when constructing salvage therapy regimens. Clinicians should consult with an expert to interpret the results of resistance assays. (<strong>I</strong>)</p>
<p>Clinicians should use a drug from a class that was not used in the first regimen when constructing a second-line regimen. (<strong>I</strong>)</p>
<p>When treating patients with high levels of HIV drug resistance, clinicians should consider using agents in novel antiretroviral classes or with unique resistance profiles, such as the entry inhibitors or drugs available through clinical trials or expanded access.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Management of Treatment Interruption</span></strong></p>
<p>Patients should be discouraged from stopping ART without first consulting with their clinician. (<strong>III</strong>)</p>
<p>When ART is interrupted, clinicians should inform patients of the potential increased risk of transmitting HIV. Risk-reduction counseling and prevention interventions should be intensified at this time.</p>
<p>Before interrupting ART in patients receiving antiretroviral medications with prolonged half-lives, such as NNRTIs, clinicians should consult with a provider with extensive experience in HIV treatment for guidance on how to avoid the emergence of resistance.</p>
<p>Clinicians should not interrupt lamivudine, emtricitabine, or tenofovir (or combination pills containing these drugs) in patients who are co-infected with chronic hepatitis B without implementing another hepatitis B virus (HBV) treatment option.</p>
<p>Strategic treatment interruption (STI) is not recommended in the management of the HIV-infected patient. (<strong>I</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Referring Patients to Research Studies</span></strong></p>
<p>Referral of patients to research protocols should be 1) to provide treatment or diagnostic options that may be otherwise unavailable and that may enhance treatment outcome, and 2) to attempt to answer a relevant research question. (<strong>III</strong>)</p>
<p>Patients should be fully informed of any financial benefit their referral to a research study might have for the referring clinician. (<strong>III</strong>)</p>
<p>Patients should be informed that research studies often require major commitments of time and effort in addition to potential unforeseeable risk. (<strong>III</strong>)</p>
<p>The clinician should provide assistance to patients who want to participate in research studies. (<strong>III</strong>)</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The AIDS Institute's Office of the Medical Director directly oversees the development, publication, dissemination and implementation of clinical practice guidelines, in collaboration with The Johns Hopkins University, Division of Infectious Diseases. These guidelines address the medical management of adults, adolescents and children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; primary and secondary prevention in medical settings; and include informational brochures for care providers and the public.</p>
<p><strong>Guidelines Dissemination</strong></p>
<p>Guidelines are disseminated to clinicians, support service providers, and consumers through mass mailings and numerous AIDS Institute-sponsored educational programs. Distribution methods include the HIV Clinical Resource website, the Clinical Education Initiative (CEI), the AIDS Educational Training Centers (AETC), and the HIV/AIDS Materials Initiative. Printed copies of clinical guidelines are available for order from the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) Distribution Center.</p>
<p><strong>Guidelines Implementation</strong></p>
<p>The HIV Clinical Guidelines Program works with other programs in the AIDS Institute to promote adoption of guidelines. Clinicians, for example, are targeted through the CEI and the AETC. The CEI provides tailored educational programming on site for health care providers on important topics in HIV care, including those addressed by the HIV Clinical Guidelines Program. The AETC provides conferences, grand rounds and other programs that cover topics contained in AIDS Institute guidelines.</p>
<p>Support service providers are targeted through the HIV Education and Training initiative which provides training on important HIV topics to non-physician health and human services providers. Education is carried out across the State as well as through video conferencing and audio conferencing.</p>
<p>The HIV Clinical Guidelines Program also works in a coordinated manner with the HIV Quality of Care Program to promote implementation of HIV guidelines in New York State. By developing quality indicators based on the guidelines, the AIDS Institute has created a mechanism for measurement of performance that allows providers and consumers to know to what extent specific guidelines have been implemented.</p>
<p>Finally, best practices booklets are developed through the HIV Clinical Guidelines Program. These contain practical solutions to common problems related to access, delivery or coordination of care, in an effort to ensure that HIV guidelines are implemented and that patients receive the highest level of HIV care possible.</p></div>"/>
