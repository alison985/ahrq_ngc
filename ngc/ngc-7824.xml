	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p>For patients with dementia, consider the following characteristics useful for identifying patients at increased risk for unsafe driving:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale (<strong>Level A</strong>) </li>

<p>For patients with dementia, consider the following characteristics not useful for identifying patients at increased risk for unsafe driving:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>A patient's self-rating of safe driving ability (<strong>Level A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Lack of situational avoidance (<strong>Level C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the benefit of neuropsychological testing, after controlling for the presence and severity of dementia, or interventional strategies for drivers with dementia (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Definitions</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective, or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.)*</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective, or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective, or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an &quot;A&quot; recommendation if 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &amp;gt;5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &amp;gt;2).</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Evidence for Diagnostic Accuracy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong> = A cohort study with prospective data collection of a broad spectrum of persons with the suspected condition, using an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The diagnostic test is objective or performed and interpreted without knowledge of the patient's clinical status. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong> = A case control study of a broad spectrum of persons with the condition established by an acceptable reference standard compared to a broad spectrum of controls or a cohort study where a broad spectrum of persons with the suspected condition where the data was collected retrospectively. The diagnostic test is objective or performed and interpreted without knowledge of disease status. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong> = A case control study or cohort study where either persons with the condition or controls are of a narrow spectrum. The condition is established by an acceptable reference standard. The reference standard and diagnostic test are objective or performed and interpreted by different observers. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong> = Studies not meeting Class I, II or III criteria including consensus, expert opinion or a case report.</p></div>"/>

<p>Relevant articles published between 1970 and December 2006 were identified using the search strategy listed in appendix e-3 on the Neurology&amp;reg; Web site at <a href=&quot;http://www.neurology.org&quot; title=&quot;Neurology Journal Web site&quot;>www.neurology.org</a>.</p>
<p>The lead author and a university research librarian searched the Medline database for relevant articles with English abstracts published between 1970 and December 2006. The search strategy is listed on the <a href=&quot;http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/full/WNL.0b013e3181da3b0f/DC1?maxtoshow=&amp;amp;hits=10&amp;amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;amp;fulltext=driving+risk&amp;amp;searchid=1&amp;amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;amp;resourcetype=HWCIT&quot; title=&quot;Neurology Journal Web site&quot;>Neurology&amp;reg; Web site</a>. A second computer-assisted search examined CINAHL, Academic Search Premier, PsycInfo, Global Health, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, NTIS, Health and Safety Science Abstracts, Risk Abstracts, Web of Science, Ageline, WorldCat, and TRIS. Next, the SafetyLit database was searched using the keyword &quot;driving&quot; (only one search word is permitted). A secondary bibliography search of all full-text articles was performed.</p>
<p>Sources were excluded if they:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Did not present primary research findings. </li>
    <li>Included drivers who had confounding medical conditions such as major psychiatric diseases, vestibular disorders, alcoholism, or other forms of drug addiction. </li>

    <li>Involve persons with some type of neurological condition, which includes aging. </li>
</ul>
<p>Of approximately 6,000 studies identified by the search strategy, 422 were selected for full-text review. A secondary bibliography search yielded 80 additional references.</p>

Differences between reviewers were adjudicated by a second QSS member.</p>
<p>The panel reviewed studies of patients with dementia of any cause or mild cognitive impairment. Population studies of aged drivers without an a priori diagnosis of dementia were accepted for analysis when studies limited to drivers with dementia were unavailable or inconclusive. The justification for this is based on the strong correlation between aging and dementia, and the fact that these studies frequently identified individuals with cognitive impairment without a previous diagnosis of dementia. To account for spectrum bias, such studies were downgraded by one evidence class, per QSS precedent.</p>
<p>The panel considered standardized on-road driving tests (ORDTs) to be the most valid measure. State-administered ORDTs are the de facto legal determinant of driving ability. Driving simulator studies can evaluate driving behavior in (simulated) dangerous circumstances, but have varying degrees of standardization and validity. Crash data are somewhat insensitive, because not all certifiably unsafe drivers have had a crash, and nonspecific, because not all drivers with an at-fault crash are unsafe drivers.</p>
<p>Cohort studies were judged to have a narrow spectrum if they excluded subjects based upon the value of a predictor variable (e.g., a study of the predictive ability of the Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] that excluded subjects with MMSE scores less than 25). Case-control studies were judged to have a narrow spectrum if they excluded equivocal outcomes (e.g., a study of at-fault crashes that excluded crashes with indeterminate at fault status).</p></div>"/>

<p>American Academy of Neurology (AAN) invited neurologists, a neuropsychologist, an occupational therapist with content domain expertise, and neurologists with methodologic expertise to perform this review.</p>
<p>This practice parameter is an update of the 2000 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) practice parameter on driving and dementia. In addition, this parameter seeks to identify historical features that are associated with increased driving risk. The following clinical questions were developed:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot;>
    <li>How strongly are global measures of dementia severity associated with decreased driving ability? </li>
    <li>To what extent are patients and their caregivers able to assess driving ability and risk? </li>
    <li>Which elements of the driving history are associated with decreased driving ability? </li>
    <li>Which neuropsychological tests provide additional prognostic information? </li>
    <li>Are there any interventions that reduce driving risk? </li>
</ol>
<p>The strength of the practice recommendations was directly linked to the class of evidence using the scheme described in the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>2013 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>

    <li>This statement is provided as an educational service of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN). It is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. It is not intended to include all possible proper methods of care for a particular neurologic problem or all legitimate criteria for choosing to use a specific procedure. Neither is it intended to exclude any reasonable alternative methodologies. The AAN recognizes that specific patient care decisions are the prerogative of the patient and the physician caring for the patient, based on all of the circumstances involved. The clinical context section is made available in order to place the evidence-based guideline(s) into perspective with current practice habits and challenges. No formal practice recommendations should be inferred. </li>
    <li>Qualitative risk estimates, based on imperfect data, are a familiar part of clinical practice. However, clinicians may be less comfortable making such judgments in a legal context; for example, to comply with mandatory state reporting of dementia that &quot;could&quot; (Pennsylvania), &quot;may&quot; (Oregon), or &quot;is likely to&quot; (California) result in driving impairment. When the threshold for &quot;likely&quot; impairment is low (e.g., CA: &quot;inability to perform one or more functions of daily living&quot;) or unclear, some clinicians may choose to report borderline cases. In some states, doing so may leave them open to civil litigation. This practice parameter cannot operationalize these types of subjective statutory requirements; it is intended for use in a clinical setting to assist in an evidence-based estimate of driving risk. </li>

<p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is committed to producing independent, critical and truthful clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Significant efforts are made to minimize the potential for conflicts of interests to influence the recommendation of this CPG. To the extent possible, the AAN keeps separate those who have a financial stake in the success or failure of the products appraised in the CPGs and the developers of the guidelines. Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee prior to project initiation. AAN limits the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest. The AAN forbids commercial participation in, or funding of, guideline projects. Drafts of the guidelines have been reviewed by at least three AAN committees, a network of neurologists, Neurology&amp;reg; peer reviewers, and representatives from related fields.
