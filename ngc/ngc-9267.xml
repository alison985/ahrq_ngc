</ul>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Prevention and Treatment of AKI</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Hemodynamic Monitoring and Support for Prevention and Management of AKI</strong></p>
<p><em>Fluids</em></p>
<p>3.1.1: In the absence of hemorrhagic shock, the Work Group suggests using isotonic crystalloids rather than colloids (albumin or starches) as initial management for expansion of intravascular volume in patients at risk for AKI or with AKI. (<em><strong>2B</strong></em>)</p>
<p><em>Vasopressors</em></p>
<p>3.1.2: The Work Group recommends the use of vasopressors in conjunction with fluids in patients with vasomotor shock with, or at risk for, AKI. (<em><strong>1C</strong></em>)</p>
<p><em>Protocolized Hemodynamic Management</em></p>
<p>3.1.3: The Work Group suggests using protocol-based management of hemodynamic and oxygenation parameters to prevent development or worsening of AKI in high-risk patients in the perioperative setting (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>) or in patients with septic shock. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>)</p>
<p><strong>Glycemic Control and Nutritional Support</strong></p>
<p><em>Glycemic Control in Critical Illness: Renal Effects and Outcomes</em></p>
<p>3.3.1: In critically ill patients, the Work Group suggests insulin therapy targeting plasma glucose 110&amp;ndash;149 mg/dl (6.1&amp;ndash;8.3 mmol/l). (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>)</p>
<p><em>Nutritional Aspects in the Prevention and Treatment of Critically Ill Patients with AKI</em></p>
<p>3.3.2: The Work Group suggests achieving a total energy intake of 20&amp;ndash;30 kcal/kg/d in patients with any stage of AKI. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>)</p>
<p>3.3.3: The Work Group suggests to avoid restriction of protein intake with the aim of preventing or delaying initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT). (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>)</p>
<p>3.3.4: The Work Group suggests administering 0.8&amp;ndash;1.0 g/kg/d of protein in noncatabolic AKI patients without need for dialysis (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>), 1.0&amp;ndash;1.5 g/kg/d in patients with AKI on RRT (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>), and up to a maximum of 1.7 g/kg/d in patients on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and in hypercatabolic patients. (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>)</p>
<p>3.3.5: The Work Group suggests providing nutrition preferentially via the enteral route in patients with AKI. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>)</p>
<p><strong>The Use of Diuretics in AKI</strong></p>
<p>3.4.1: The Work Group recommends not using diuretics to prevent AKI. (<em><strong>1B</strong></em>)</p>
<p>3.4.2: The Work Group suggests not using diuretics to treat AKI, except in the management of volume overload. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>)</p>
<p><strong>Vasodilator Therapy: Dopamine, Fenoldopam, and Natriuretic Peptides</strong></p>
<p><em>Dopamine for the Prevention or Treatment of AKI</em></p>
<p>3.5.1: The Work Group recommends not using low-dose dopamine to prevent or treat AKI. (<em><strong>1A</strong></em>)</p>
<p><em>Fenoldopam for the Prevention or Treatment of AKI</em></p>
<p>3.5.2 The Work Group suggests not using fenoldopam to prevent or treat AKI. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>)</p>
<p><em>Natriuretic Peptides for the Prevention or Treatment of AKI</em></p>
<p>3.5.3: The Work Group suggests not using atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) to prevent (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>) or treat (<em><strong>2B</strong></em>) AKI.</p>
<p><strong>Growth Factor Intervention</strong></p>
<p>3.6.1: The Work Group recommends not using recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-1 (rh)IGF-1 to prevent or treat AKI. (<em><strong>1B</strong></em>)</p>
<p><strong>Adenosine Receptor Antagonists</strong></p>
<p>3.7.1: The Work Group suggests that a single dose of theophylline may be given in neonates with severe perinatal asphyxia, who are at high risk of AKI. (<em><strong>2B</strong></em>)</p>
<p><strong>Prevention of Aminoglycoside- and Amphotericin-related AKI</strong></p>
<p><em>Aminoglycoside Nephrotoxicity</em></p>
<p>3.8.1: The Work Group suggests not using aminoglycosides for the treatment of infections unless no suitable, less nephrotoxic, therapeutic alternatives are available. (<em><strong>2A</strong></em>)</p>
<p>3.8.2: The Work Group suggests that, in patients with normal kidney function in steady state, aminoglycosides are administered as a single dose daily rather than multiple-dose daily treatment regimens. (<em><strong>2B</strong></em>)</p>
<p>3.8.3: The Work Group recommends monitoring aminoglycoside drug levels when treatment with multiple daily dosing is used for more than 24 hours. (<em><strong>1A</strong></em>)</p>

<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Contrast-induced AKI</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Contrast-induced AKI: Definition, Epidemiology, and Prognosis</strong></p>
<p><em>Background</em></p>
<p>4.1: Define and stage AKI after administration of intravascular contrast media as per Recommendations 2.1.1&amp;ndash;2.1.2. (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>)</p>
<p class=&quot;Indent&quot;>4.1.1: In individuals who develop changes in kidney function after administration of intravascular contrast media, evaluate for contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) as well as for other possible causes of AKI. (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>)</p>
<p><strong>Assessment of the Population at Risk for CI-AKI</strong></p>
<p>4.2.1 Assess the risk for CI-AKI and, in particular, screen for pre-existing impairment of kidney function in all patients who are considered for a procedure that requires intravascular (i.v. or intraarterial [i.a.]) administration of iodinated contrast medium. (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>)</p>
<p>4.2.2: Consider alternative imaging methods in patients at increased risk for CI-AKI. (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>)</p>
<p><strong>Nonpharmacological Prevention Strategies of CI-AKI</strong></p>
<p><em>Dose/Volume of Contrast-Media Administration</em></p>
<p>4.3.1: Use the lowest possible dose of contrast medium in patients at risk for CI-AKI. (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>)</p>
<p><em>Selection of a Contrast Agent</em></p>
<p>4.3.2: The Work Group recommends using either iso-osmolar or low-osmolar iodinated contrast media, rather than high-osmolar iodinated contrast media in patients at increased risk of CI-AKI. (<em><strong>1B</strong></em>)</p>
<p><strong>Pharmacological Prevention Strategies of CI-AKI</strong></p>
<p><em>Fluid Administration</em></p>
<p>4.4.1: The Work Group recommends i.v. volume expansion with either isotonic sodium chloride or sodium bicarbonate solutions, rather than no i.v. volume expansion, in patients at increased risk for CI-AKI. (<em><strong>1A</strong></em>)</p>
<p>4.4.2: The Work Group recommends not using oral fluids alone in patients at increased risk of CI-AKI. (<em><strong>1C</strong></em>)</p>
<p><em>Role of NAC in the Prevention of CI-AKI</em></p>
<p>4.4.3: The Work Group suggests using oral NAC, together with i.v. isotonic crystalloids, in patients at increased risk of CI-AKI. (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>)</p>
<p><em>Theophylline and Fenoldopam in Prevention of CI-AKI</em></p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Theophylline</span></p>
<p>4.4.4: The Work Group suggests not using theophylline to prevent CI-AKI. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>)</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Fenoldopam</span></p>
<p>4.4.5: The Work Group recommends not using fenoldopam to prevent CI-AKI. (<em><strong>1B</strong></em>)</p>
<p><strong>Effects of Hemodialysis or Hemofiltration</strong></p>
<p>4.5.1: The Work Group suggests not using prophylactic intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) or hemofiltration (HF) for contrast-media removal in patients at increased risk for CI-AKI. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Dialysis Interventions for Treatment of AKI</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Timing of Renal Replacement Therapy in AKI</strong></p>
<p>5.1.1: Initiate RRT emergently when life-threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance exist. (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>)</p>
<p>5.1.2: Consider the broader clinical context, the presence of conditions that can be modified with RRT, and trends of laboratory tests&amp;mdash;rather than single blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine thresholds alone&amp;mdash;when making the decision to start RRT. (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>)</p>
<p><strong>Criteria for Stopping Renal Replacement Therapy in AKI</strong></p>
<p>5.2.1: Discontinue RRT when it is no longer required, either because intrinsic kidney function has recovered to the point that it is adequate to meet patient needs, or because RRT is no longer consistent with the goals of care. (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>)</p>
<p>5.2.2: The Work Group suggests not using diuretics to enhance kidney function recovery, or to reduce the duration or frequency of RRT. (<em><strong>2B</strong></em>)</p>
<p><strong>Anticoagulation</strong></p>
<p>5.3.1: In a patient with AKI requiring RRT, base the decision to use anticoagulation for RRT on assessment of the patient's potential risks and benefits from anticoagulation (see Figure 17 in the original guideline document). (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>)</p>
<p class=&quot;Indent&quot;>5.3.1.1: The Work Group recommends using anticoagulation during RRT in AKI if a patient does not have an increased bleeding risk or impaired coagulation and is not already receiving systemic anticoagulation. (<em><strong>1B</strong></em>)</p>
<p>5.3.2: For patients without an increased bleeding risk or impaired coagulation and not already receiving effective systemic anticoagulation, the Work Group suggests the following:</p>
<p class=&quot;Indent&quot;>5.3.2.1: For anticoagulation in intermittent RRT, the Work Group recommends using either unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin, rather than other anticoagulants. (<em><strong>1C</strong></em>)</p>
<p class=&quot;Indent&quot;>5.3.2.2: For anticoagulation in continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), the Work Group suggests using regional citrate anticoagulation rather than heparin in patients who do not have contraindications for citrate. (<em><strong>2B</strong></em>)</p>
<p class=&quot;Indent&quot;>5.3.2.3: For anticoagulation during CRRT in patients who have contraindications for citrate, the Work Group suggests using either unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin, rather than other anticoagulants. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>)</p>
<p>5.3.3: For patients with increased bleeding risk who are not receiving anticoagulation, the Work Group suggests the following for anticoagulation during RRT:</p>
<p class=&quot;Indent&quot;>5.3.3.1: The Work Group suggests using regional citrate anticoagulation, rather than no anticoagulation, during CRRT in a patient without contraindications for citrate. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>)</p>
<p class=&quot;Indent&quot;>5.3.3.2: The Work Group suggests avoiding regional heparinization during CRRT in a patient with increased risk of bleeding. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>)</p>
<p>5.3.4: In a patient with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), all heparin must be stopped and the Work Group recommends using direct thrombin inhibitors (such as argatroban) or Factor Xa inhibitors (such as danaparoid or fondaparinux) rather than other or no anticoagulation during RRT. (<em><strong>1A</strong></em>)</p>
<p class=&quot;Indent&quot;>5.3.4.1: In a patient with HIT who does not have severe liver failure, the Work Group suggests using argatroban rather than other thrombin or Factor Xa inhibitors during RRT. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>)</p>
<p><strong>Vascular Access for Renal Replacement Therapy in AKI</strong></p>
<p>5.4.1: The Work Group suggests initiating RRT in patients with AKI via an uncuffed nontunneled dialysis catheter, rather than a tunneled catheter. (<em><strong>2D</strong></em>)</p>
<p>5.4.2: When choosing a vein for insertion of a dialysis catheter in patients with AKI, consider these preferences (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>):</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>First choice: right jugular vein </li>
    <li>Second choice: femoral vein </li>
    <li>Third choice: left jugular vein </li>
    <li>Last choice: subclavian vein with preference for the dominant side </li>
</ul>
<p>5.4.3: The Work Group recommends using ultrasound guidance for dialysis catheter insertion. (<em><strong>1A</strong></em>)</p>
<p>5.4.4: The Work Group recommends obtaining a chest radiograph promptly after placement and before first use of an internal jugular or subclavian dialysis catheter. (<em><strong>1B</strong></em>)</p>
<p>5.4.5: The Work Group suggests not using topical antibiotics over the skin insertion site of a nontunneled dialysis catheter in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with AKI requiring RRT. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>)</p>
<p>5.4.6: The Work Group suggests not using antibiotic locks for prevention of catheter-related infections of nontunneled dialysis catheters in AKI requiring RRT. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>)</p>
<p><strong>Dialyzer Membranes for Renal Replacement Therapy in AKI</strong></p>
<p>5.5.1: The Work Group suggests to use dialyzers with a biocompatible membrane for IHD and CRRT in patients with AKI. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>)</p>
<p><strong>Modality of Renal Replacement Therapy for Patients with AKI</strong></p>
<p>5.6.1: Use continuous and intermittent RRT as complementary therapies in AKI patients. (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>)</p>
<p>5.6.2: The Work Group suggests using CRRT, rather than standard intermittent RRT, for hemodynamically unstable patients. (<em><strong>2B</strong></em>)</p>
<p>5.6.3: The Work Group suggests using CRRT, rather than intermittent RRT, for AKI patients with acute brain injury or other causes of increased intracranial pressure or generalized brain edema. (<em><strong>2B</strong></em>)</p>
<p><strong>Buffer Solutions for Renal Replacement Therapy in Patients with AKI</strong></p>
<p>5.7.1: The Work Group suggests using bicarbonate, rather than lactate, as a buffer in dialysate and replacement fluid for RRT in patients with AKI. (<em><strong>2C</strong></em>)</p>
<p>5.7.2: The Work Group recommends using bicarbonate, rather than lactate, as a buffer in dialysate and replacement fluid for RRT in patients with AKI and circulatory shock. (<em><strong>1B</strong></em>)</p>
<p>5.7.3: The Work Group suggests using bicarbonate, rather than lactate, as a buffer in dialysate and replacement fluid for RRT in patients with AKI and liver failure and/or lactic acidemia. (<em><strong>2B</strong></em>)</p>
<p>5.7.4: The Work Group recommends that dialysis fluids and replacement fluids in patients with AKI, at a minimum, comply with American Association of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standards regarding contamination with bacteria and endotoxins. (<em><strong>1B</strong></em>)</p>
<p><strong>Dose of RRT in AKI</strong></p>
<p>5.8.1: The dose of RRT to be delivered should be prescribed before starting each session of RRT. (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>) The Work Group recommends frequent assessment of the actual delivered dose in order to adjust the prescription. (<em><strong>1B</strong></em>)</p>
<p>5.8.2: Provide RRT to achieve the goals of electrolyte, acid-base, solute, and fluid balance that will meet the patient's needs. (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>)</p>
<p>5.8.3: The Work Group recommends delivering a Kt/V of 3.9 per week when using intermittent or extended RRT in AKI. (<em><strong>1A</strong></em>)</p>
<p>5.8.4: The Work Group recommends delivering an effluent volume of 20&amp;ndash;25 ml/kg/h for CRRT in AKI (<em><strong>1A</strong></em>). This will usually require a higher prescription of effluent volume. (<em><strong>Not Graded</strong></em>)</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Literature Search and Article Selection</strong></p>
<p>The MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Registry for trials, and Cochrane database of systematic reviews were searched by the Evidence Review Team (ERT) to capture all citations relevant to the topic of acute kidney injury (AKI), including original articles and existing systematic reviews. The search was limited to publications since 1980. For constast-induced (CI)-AKI, the ERT limited the search to publications from 1995 onward, since prior to this date the use of high-osmolar contrast agents was common. The introduction of low-osmolar contrast agents after this date resulted in testing interventions in studies using low-osmolar contrast media. Finally, when an iso-osmolar agent became available, the ERT examined studies of this agent against low-osmolar contrast agents.</p>
<p>A list of pertinent existing systematic reviews relevant to the guidelines was generated, organized by topic, and reviewed with the Work Group. If an existing systematic review adequately addressed a question of interest, and was deemed to be of sufficient quality, based on methodological rigor, this was used instead of the ERT conducting a de novo systematic review. This systematic review was then used as the starting point for building the evidence base, and was supplemented with articles from the own searches. The searches were updated through December 16, 2010. All searches were then supplemented by articles identified by Work Group members through February 2011.</p>
<p>During abstract screening, journal articles reporting original data were reviewed. Editorials, letters, stand-alone abstracts, unpublished reports, and articles published in non&amp;ndash;peer-reviewed journals were excluded. The Work Group also decided to exclude publications from journal supplements and conference proceedings, because of potential differences in the way these papers are solicited, selected, reviewed, and edited compared to peer-reviewed publications.</p>
<p>MEDLINE and Cochrane search results were screened by the ERT for relevance using predefined eligibility criteria, described below. For questions related to treatment, the systematic search aimed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with sample sizes as described in Table 19. Restrictions by sample size were based on methodological and clinical considerations. Generally, it was deemed that trials with fewer than 50 patients per arm would be unlikely to be conclusive regarding effect for patient-important clinical outcomes in AKI. However, for specific topics where only sparse data were available (e.g., the use of renal replacement therapy [RRT] to prevent CI-AKI), a lower sample size threshold was used to provide some information for descriptive purposes. For all treatment topics, RCTs in children were included if they met overall inclusion criteria for adults.</p>

<p>The Evidence Review Team (ERT) designed data-extraction forms to capture information on various aspects of the primary studies. Data fields for all topics included study setting, patient demographics, eligibility criteria, baseline kidney function (creatinine or glomerular filtration rate [GFR]), numbers of subjects randomized, study design, study funding source, descriptions of interventions, description of outcomes, statistical methods used, results, quality of outcomes (as described below), limitations to generalizability, and free-text fields for comments and assessment of biases. Additional data fields contained information relevant to specific questions.</p>
<p><strong>Summary Tables</strong></p>
<p>For each question of intervention, summary tables were developed to tabulate the data from studies pertinent. Each summary table contains a brief description of the baseline characteristics of the population, intervention and control treatments, concomitant therapy, outcomes, and methodological quality for each outcome. Baseline characteristics include a description of the study size, country of residence, age, baseline kidney function, and setting or procedure. The studies were listed by outcome within the table based on the hierarchy of important outcomes (see Table 23 in Appendix F of the original guideline document). Work Group members were asked to proof and review all data and quality assessments in the summary tables on randomized controlled trials (RCTs).</p>
<p>Summary tables and evidence profiles are referenced in the text and published online. They are available at <a href=&quot;http://www.kdigo.org&quot;>www.kdigo.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Grading the Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>A structured approach, based on Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) and facilitated by the use of evidence profiles, was employed in order to grade the quality of the overall evidence. For each topic, the discussion on grading of the quality of the evidence was led by the ERT.

<p>Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines focus on topics related to the prevention of&amp;mdash;or management of individuals with&amp;mdash;kidney diseases. General information on the KDIGO guideline development process is available at <a href=&quot;http://www.kdigo.org/clinical_practice_guidelines/MethodsDevelopment.php&quot; title=&quot;KDIGO Web site&quot;>http://www.kdigo.org/clinical_practice_guidelines/MethodsDevelopment.php</a>.</p>
<p>The development of this particular guideline includes many sequential and concurrent steps:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Appoint the Work Group and Evidence Review Team (ERT), which were responsible for different aspects of the process. </li>
    <li>Confer to discuss process, methods, and results. </li>
    <li>Develop and refine topics. </li>
    <li>Triage topics to systematic review or narrative review. </li>
    <li>Define specific populations, interventions or predictors, and outcomes of interest for systematic review topics. </li>
    <li>Create and standardize quality assessment methods. </li>
    <li>Create data extraction forms. </li>
    <li>Develop literature search strategies and run searches. </li>
    <li>Screen abstracts and retrieve full articles based on predetermined eligibility criteria. </li>
    <li>Perform &quot;reverse engineering,&quot; i.e., use of existing systematic reviews to refine questions. </li>
    <li>Extract data and perform critical appraisal of the literature. </li>
    <li>Grade quality of the outcomes of each study. </li>
    <li>Tabulate data from articles into summary tables. </li>
    <li>Grade the quality of evidence for each outcome and assess the overall quality and findings of bodies of evidence with the aid of evidence profiles. </li>
    <li>Write recommendations and supporting rationale statements. </li>
    <li>Grade the strength of the recommendations based on the quality of the evidence and other considerations. </li>
    <li>Conduct peer review by KDIGO Board of Directors in December, 2009 and the public prior to publication in 2011. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Group Member Selection and Meeting Process</strong></p>
<p>The KDIGO Co-Chairs appointed the Co-Chairs of the Work Group, who then assembled the Work Group to be responsible for the development of the guideline. The Work Group consisted of domain experts, including individuals with expertise in nephrology, critical care medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, cardiology, radiology, infectious diseases and epidemiology. For support in evidence review, expertise in methods, and guideline development, the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) contracted with the Evidence Review Team (ERT) based primarily at the Tufts Center for Kidney Disease Guideline Development and Implementation at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. The ERT consisted of physician-methodologists with expertise in nephrology and internal medicine, and research associates and assistants. The ERT instructed and advised Work Group members in all steps of literature review, critical literature appraisal, and guideline development. The Work Group and the ERT collaborated closely throughout the project. The Work Group, KDIGO Co-Chairs, ERT, liaisons, and NKF support staff met for four 2-day meetings for training in the guideline development process, topic discussion, and consensus development.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Selection, Appraisal, and Presentation</strong></p>
<p>The Work Group and ERT first defined the topics and goals for the guideline and identified key clinical questions for review. The ERT performed literature searches, organized abstract and article screening, coordinated methodological and analytic processes of the report, defined and standardized the search methodology, performed data extraction, and summarized the evidence. The Work Group members reviewed all included articles, data extraction forms, summary tables, and evidence profiles for accuracy and completeness. The four major topic areas of interest for AKI included: i) definition and classification; ii) prevention; iii) pharmacologic treatment; and iv) RRT. Populations of interest were those at risk for AKI (including those after intravascular contrast-media exposure, aminoglycosides, and amphotericin) and those with or at risk for AKI with a focus on patients with sepsis or trauma, receiving critical care, or undergoing cardiothoracic surgery. The excluded studies were on AKI from rhabdomyolysis, specific infections, and poisoning or drug overdose.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome Selection Judgments, Values, and Preferences</strong></p>
<p>The Work Group and ERT limited outcomes to those important for decision making, including development of AKI, need for or dependence on RRT, and all-cause mortality. When weighting the evidence across different outcomes, the Work Group selected as the &quot;crucial&quot; outcome that which weighed most heavily in the assessment of the overall quality of evidence. Values and preferences articulated by the Work Group included: i) a desire to be inclusive in terms of meeting criteria for AKI; ii) a progressive approach to risk and cost such that, as severity increased, the group put greater value on possible effectiveness of strategies, but maintained high value for avoidance of harm; iii) intent to guide practice but not limit future research.</p>
<p><strong>Grading the Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>A structured approach, based on Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) and facilitated by the use of evidence profiles, was employed in order to grade the strength of a recommendation. For each topic, the discussion on grading of the quality of the evidence was led by the ERT, and the discussion regarding the strength of the recommendations was led by the Work Group Chairs. The &quot;strength of a recommendation&quot; indicates the extent to which one can be confident that adherence to the recommendation will do more good than harm.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Use of the Clinical Practice Guideline</strong></p>
<p>This Clinical Practice Guideline document is based upon the best information available as of February 2011. It is designed to provide information and assist decision-making. It is not intended to define a standard of care, and should not be construed as one, nor should it be interpreted as prescribing an exclusive course of management. Variations in practice will inevitably and appropriately occur when clinicians take into account the needs of individual patients, available resources, and limitations unique to an institution or type of practice. Every health-care professional making use of these recommendations is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of applying them in the setting of any particular clinical situation. The recommendations for research contained within this document are general and do not imply a specific protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>
<p>There are important limitations to the recommendations for definition and staging of acute kidney injury (AKI), including imprecise determination of risk (see Chapter 2.2 in the original guideline document) and incomplete epidemiology of AKI, especially outside the intensive care unit (ICU). Clinical judgment is required in order to determine if patients seeming to meet criteria do, in fact, have disease, as well as to determine if patients are likely to have AKI even if incomplete clinical data are available to apply the diagnostic criteria. The application of the diagnostic and staging criteria is discussed in greater detail, along with specific examples in Chapter 2.4 of the original guideline document.</p>
<p>The use of urine output criteria for diagnosis and staging has been less well validated and in individual patients the need for clinical judgment regarding the effects of drugs (e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACE-I]), fluid balance, and other factors must be included. For very obese patients, urine output criteria for AKI may include some patients with normal urine output. However, these recommendations serve as the starting point for further evaluation, possibly involving subspecialists, for a group of patients recognized to be at increased risk.</p>
<p>Finally, it is axiomatic that patients always be managed according to the cause of their disease, and thus it is important to determine the cause of AKI whenever possible. In particular, patients with decreased kidney perfusion, acute glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, interstitial nephritis, thrombotic microangiopathy, and urinary tract obstruction require immediate diagnosis and specific therapeutic intervention, in addition to the general recommendations for AKI in the remainder of this guideline (see Table 5 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>It is recognized that it is frequently not possible to determine the cause, and often the exact cause does not dictate a specific therapy. However, the syndrome of AKI includes some patients with specific kidney diseases (e.g., glomerulonephritis) for which a specific treatment is available. As such, it is always necessary to search for the underlying cause of AKI (see Chapter 2.3 in the original guideline document).</p></div>"/>
