      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) grades its recommendations (<strong>A, B, C, D,</strong> or <strong>I</strong>) and identifies the Levels of Certainty regarding Net Benefit (<strong>High, Moderate,</strong> and <strong>Low</strong>). The definitions of these grades can be found at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Summary of Recommendations and Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The USPSTF recommends that clinicians engage in shared, informed decision making with women who are at increased risk for breast cancer about medications to reduce their risk. For women who are at increased risk for breast cancer and at low risk for adverse medication effects, clinicians should offer to prescribe risk-reducing medications, such as tamoxifen or raloxifene. (<strong>B recommendation</strong>)</p>
<p>See the Clinical Considerations section for additional information about risk factors.</p>
<p>The USPSTF recommends against the routine use of medications, such as tamoxifen or raloxifene, for risk reduction of primary breast cancer in women who are not at increased risk for breast cancer. (<strong>D recommendation</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Clinical Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Patient Population Under Consideration</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women aged 35 years or older without a prior diagnosis of breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). Neither tamoxifen nor raloxifene should be used in women who have a history of thromboembolic events (deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, stroke, or transient ischemic attack). The USPSTF has issued separate recommendations for women with BRCA gene mutations (available at <a href=&quot;http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org&quot; title=&quot;USPSTF Web site&quot;>www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Assessment of Breast Cancer Risk</strong></p>
<p>If a family history of breast cancer or a personal history of breast biopsy is found during the usual patient assessment, clinicians may consider further evaluation using a breast cancer risk assessment tool. Risk assessment tools specifically for family history of breast cancer are available elsewhere (<a href=&quot;http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org&quot; title=&quot;USPSTF Web site&quot;>www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute has developed a Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (available at <a href=&quot;http://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool&quot; title=&quot;Cancer.gov Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool</a>) that is based on the Gail model and estimates the 5-year incidence of invasive breast cancer in women on the basis of characteristics entered into a risk calculator. This tool helps identify women who may be at increased risk for the disease. Other risk assessment models have been developed by the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC), Rosner and Colditz, Chlebowski, Tyrer and Cuzick, and others.</p>
<p>Examples of risk factors elicited by risk assessment tools include patient age, race or ethnicity, age at menarche, age at first live childbirth, personal history of DCIS or LCIS, number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer, personal history of breast biopsy, body mass index, menopause status or age, breast density, estrogen and progestin use, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, and diet.</p>
<p>These models are not recommended for use in women with a personal history of breast cancer, a history of radiation treatment to the chest, or a possible family history of mutations in the <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> genes. Only a small fraction of women are at increased risk for breast cancer. Most who are at increased risk will not develop the disease, and most cases will arise in women who are not identified as being at increased risk. Risk assessment should be repeated when there is a significant change in breast cancer risk factors.</p>
<p>There is no single cutoff for defining increased risk. Most clinical trials defined increased risk as a 5-year risk for invasive breast cancer of 1.66% or greater, as determined by the BCPT (Breast Cancer Prevention Trial). At this cutoff, however, many women would not have a net benefit from risk-reducing medications. Freedman and colleagues developed risk tables that incorporate the BCPT estimate of a woman's breast cancer risk as well as her age, race or ethnicity, and presence of uterus.</p>
<p>On the basis of the Freedman risk&amp;ndash;benefit tables for women aged 50 years or older (refer to Figures 2 and 3 and Appendix Figures 1 and 2 in the original guideline document), the USPSTF concludes that many women with an estimated 5-year breast cancer risk of 3% or greater are likely to have more benefit than harm from using tamoxifen or raloxifene, although the balance depends on age, race or ethnicity, the medication used, and whether the patient has a uterus.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment of Risk for Adverse Effects</strong></p>
<p>In general, women receiving medications for breast cancer risk reduction are less likely to have venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) if they are younger and have no other predisposition to thromboembolic events. Women with a personal or family history of venous thromboembolism are at higher risk for these adverse effects.</p>
<p>Women without a uterus are not at risk for tamoxifen-related endometrial cancer. Women with a uterus should have a baseline gynecologic examination before treatment with tamoxifen is started, with regular follow-up after the end of treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Medications for Breast Cancer Risk Reduction</strong></p>
<p>Selective estrogen receptor modulators (tamoxifen and raloxifene) have been shown to reduce the incidence of invasive breast cancer in several randomized, controlled trials. Tamoxifen has been approved for this use in women aged 35 years or older, and raloxifene has been approved for this use in postmenopausal women.</p>
<p>The usual daily doses for tamoxifen and raloxifene are 20 mg and 60 mg, respectively, for 5 years. Aromatase inhibitors (exemestane) have not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this indication and are therefore beyond the scope of this recommendation.</p>
<p>Tamoxifen is not recommended for use in combination with hormone therapy or hormonal contraception or in women who are pregnant, may become pregnant, or are breastfeeding.</p>
<p><strong>Other Approaches to Prevention</strong></p>
<p>The USPSTF recommendation on risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA-related cancer can be found at <a href=&quot;http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org&quot; title=&quot;USPSTF Web site&quot;>www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>. Clinical trials of tamoxifen and raloxifene have not been conducted specifically in women who are BRCA mutation carriers.</p>
<p><strong>Other Resources</strong></p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute provides information about potential ways to prevent cancer, including lifestyle and diet changes (available at <a href=&quot;http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/prevention/breast/Patient&quot; title=&quot;Cancer.gov Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/prevention/breast/Patient</a> and <a href=&quot;http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/basic_info/prevention.htm&quot; title=&quot;CDC Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/basic_info/prevention.htm</a>).</p>
<p>The USPSTF does not endorse any particular risk prediction model. However, the BCPT model (<a href=&quot;http://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool&quot; title=&quot;Cancer.gov Web site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool</a>) and the BCSC model (<a href=&quot;https://tools.bcsc-scc.org/BC5yearRisk&quot; title=&quot;Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium Web site&quot;>https://tools.bcsc-scc.org/BC5yearRisk</a>) can be used by clinicians and patients as part of the process of shared, informed decision making. Both models have been calibrated in U.S. populations.</p>

<p><strong>USPSTF Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benefit</strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The USPSTF defines <em>certainty</em> as &quot;likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct.&quot; The net benefit is defined as benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level based on the nature of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: A systematic evidence review was prepared by the Oregon Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC), Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><strong>Data Sources</strong></p>
<p>EPC staff searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception through 5 December 2012 for relevant English-language studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. EPC staff manually reviewed reference lists of articles, citations in Web of Science and Scopus, and clinical trial registries. EPC staff requested scientific information packets from manufacturers of medications. (The only packet provided was for raloxifene.)</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection</strong></p>
<p>EPC staff developed selection criteria for studies based on the patient populations, interventions, outcome measures, and types of evidence. After an initial review of citations and abstracts, full-text articles of potentially relevant material were retrieved and a second review was conducted to determine inclusion. A second reviewer confirmed results of the initial reviewer, and discrepancies were resolved by team consensus. Results of the search and selection process are provided in the Appendix Figure in the systematic review.</p>
<p>Inclusion criteria for studies of benefits, harms, and subgroup outcomes (key questions 1 through 3) have been fully described in previous publications. For benefits, EPC staff included only double-blind, placebo-controlled or head-to-head, randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) of tamoxifen and raloxifene to reduce risk for breast cancer that enrolled women without preexisting breast cancer. EPC staff included trials that were designed and powered to demonstrate invasive breast cancer incidence as a primary or secondary outcome. For harms, EPC staff included RCTs and observational studies of tamoxifen and raloxifene in women without breast cancer that had a nonuser comparison group or direct comparisons between tamoxifen and raloxifene. All adverse outcomes at all reported follow-up times were considered to capture potential short- and long-term adverse effects.</p>
<p>EPC staff included RCTs, observational studies, and descriptive studies of decisions to use risk-reducing medications, concordance, adherence, and persistence of use (key question 4). Concordance occurs when a health care provider and patient reach a shared agreement about therapeutic goals after the patient is informed of the condition and options for treatment and becomes involved in the treatment decision. Adherence is the extent to which a patient acts in accordance with the prescribed interval and dose of a medication. Persistence is the duration of time from initiation to discontinuation of therapy.</p>
<p>EPC staff included studies of risk-stratification models that could be used in primary care settings to identify women at higher-than-average risk for breast cancer (key question 5). Only studies reporting discriminatory accuracy were included. Discriminatory accuracy is a measure of how well the model can correctly classify persons at higher risk from those at lower risk and is measured by the model's concordance statistic or c-statistic. The c-statistic is determined by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, a plot of sensitivity (true-positive rate) versus 1 &amp;ndash; specificity (false-positive rate). Perfect discrimination is a c-statistic of 1.0, whereas a c-statistic of 0.5 would result from chance alone. An acceptable level of discrimination is between 0.70 and 0.79, excellent is between 0.80 and 0.89, and outstanding is 0.90 or greater. EPC staff also abstracted model calibration, a measure of how well predicted probabilities agree with actual observed risk in a population. In a perfect prediction model, the predicted risk in a population would equal the observed number of cases, such that the percentage expected divided by the percentage observed equals 1.0. Studies of individual risk factors or laboratory tests as well as models designed primarily to evaluate risk for deleterious BRCA mutations were excluded.</p>
<p>Search strategies also included systematic reviews that addressed key questions and had similar scope, inclusion criteria, and analytic methods for meta-analysis. Other types of analyses and statistical models were not included.</p></div>"/>

<p>*<em>A, B, C, D</em>, and <em>I (Insufficient)</em> represent the letter grades of recommendation or statement of insufficient evidence assigned by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force after assessing certainty and magnitude of net benefit of the service (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field).</p>
<p>The overarching question that the Task Force seeks to answer for every preventive service is whether evidence suggests that provision of the service would improve health outcomes if implemented in a general primary care population. For screening topics, this standard could be met by a large randomized, controlled trial (RCT) in a representative asymptomatic population with follow-up of all members of both the group &quot;invited for screening&quot; and the group &quot;not invited for screening.&quot;</p>
<p>Direct RCT evidence about screening is often unavailable, so the Task Force considers indirect evidence. To guide its selection of indirect evidence, the Task Force constructs a &quot;chain of evidence&quot; within an analytic framework. For each key question, the body of pertinent literature is critically appraised, focusing on the following 6 questions:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Do the studies have the appropriate research design to answer the key question(s)? </li>
    <li>To what extent are the existing studies of high quality? (i.e., what is the internal validity?) </li>
    <li>To what extent are the results of the studies generalizable to the general U.S. primary care population and situation? (i.e., what is the external validity?) </li>
    <li>How many studies have been conducted that address the key question(s)? How large are the studies? (i.e., what is the precision of the evidence?) </li>
    <li>How consistent are the results of the studies? </li>
    <li>Are there additional factors that assist the USPSTF in drawing conclusions (e.g., presence or absence of dose&amp;ndash;response effects, fit within a biologic model)? </li>
</ol>
<p>The next step in the Task Force process is to use the evidence from the key questions to assess whether there would be net benefit if the service were implemented. In 2001, the USPSTF published an article that documented its systematic processes of evidence evaluation and recommendation development. At that time, the Task Force's overall assessment of evidence was described as good, fair, or poor. The Task Force realized that this rating seemed to apply only to how well studies were conducted and did not fully capture all of the issues that go into an overall assessment of the evidence about net benefit. To avoid confusion, the Task Force has changed its terminology. Whereas individual study quality will continue to be characterized as good, fair, or poor, the term certainty will now be used to describe the Task Force's assessment of the overall body of evidence about net benefit of a preventive service and the likelihood that the assessment is correct. Certainty will be determined by considering all 6 questions listed above; the judgment about certainty will be described as high, moderate, or low.</p>
<p>In making its assessment of certainty about net benefit, the evaluation of the evidence from each key question plays a primary role. It is important to note that the Task Force makes recommendations for real-world medical practice in the United States and must determine to what extent the evidence for each key question&amp;mdash;even evidence from screening RCTs or treatment RCTs&amp;mdash;can be applied to the general primary care population. Frequently, studies are conducted in highly selected populations under special conditions. The Task Force must consider differences between the general primary care population and the populations studied in RCTs and make judgments about the likelihood of observing the same effect in actual practice.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that one of the key questions in the analytic framework refers to the potential harms of the preventive service. The Task Force considers the evidence about the benefits and harms of preventive services separately and equally. Data about harms are often obtained from observational studies because harms observed in RCTs may not be representative of those found in usual practice and because some harms are not completely measured and reported in RCTs.</p>
<p>Putting the body of evidence for all key questions together as a chain, the Task Force assesses the certainty of net benefit of a preventive service by asking the 6 major questions listed above. The Task Force would rate a body of convincing evidence about the benefits of a service that, for example, derives from several RCTs of screening in which the estimate of benefits can be generalized to the general primary care population as &quot;high&quot; certainty (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of Recommendations&quot; field). The Task Force would rate a body of evidence that was not clearly applicable to general practice or has other defects in quality, research design, or consistency of studies as &quot;moderate&quot; certainty. Certainty is &quot;low&quot; when, for example, there are gaps in the evidence linking parts of the analytic framework, when evidence to determine the harms of treatment is unavailable, or when evidence about the benefits of treatment is insufficient. Table 4 in the methodology document listed below (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) summarizes the current terminology used by the Task Force to describe the critical assessment of evidence at all 3 levels: individual studies, key questions, and overall certainty of net benefit of the preventive service.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Peer Review</span>. Before the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes its final determinations about recommendations on a given preventive service, the Evidence-based Practice Center and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality send a draft evidence review to 4 to 6 external experts and to Federal agencies and professional and disease-based health organizations with interests in the topic. The experts are asked to examine the review critically for accuracy and completeness and to respond to a series of specific questions about the document. After assembling these external review comments and documenting the proposed response to key comments, the topic team presents this information to the USPSTF in memo form. In this way, the USPSTF can consider these external comments before it votes on its recommendations about the service. Draft recommendation statements are then circulated for comment among reviewers representing professional societies, voluntary organizations, and Federal agencies, as well as posted on the Task Force Web site for public comment. These comments are discussed before the final recommendations are confirmed.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Response to Public Comment</span>. A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 16 April through 13 May 2013. In response to public comment and in consideration of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indications, the USPSTF provided more information about the target patient population for this recommendation. The USPSTF clarified that the recommendation applies to asymptomatic women aged 35 years or older without a prior diagnosis of breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). The final recommendation statement further clarifies that raloxifene has been approved for breast cancer risk reduction in postmenopausal women and that other groups of women should not use tamoxifen. The USPSTF reiterated that only a small fraction of women are candidates for and would derive benefit from risk-reducing medications.</p>
<p>The USPSTF also provided a more comprehensive list of breast cancer risk factors and links to additional resources in response to comments, as well as summary tables to help readers understand the risk&amp;ndash; benefit balance of these medications, links to online breast cancer risk assessment models, and updated recommendations of other groups.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Comparison with Guidelines from Other Groups</span>. Recommendations for screening from the following groups were discussed: American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, American Cancer Society (ACS), and the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care.</p></div>"/>

<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found adequate evidence that treatment with tamoxifen or raloxifene can significantly reduce the relative risk (RR) for invasive estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women who are at increased risk for breast cancer. </li>
    <li>A systematic review of clinical trials found that tamoxifen and raloxifene reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer by 7 to 9 events per 1000 women over 5 years and that tamoxifen reduced breast cancer incidence more than raloxifene (refer to Appendix Table 3 in the original guideline document). Tamoxifen also reduces the incidence of invasive breast cancer in premenopausal women who are at increased risk for the disease. </li>
    <li>Women who are at increased risk for breast cancer are more likely to benefit from risk-reducing medications. In general, women with an estimated 5-year risk of 3% or greater are, on the basis of model estimates (refer to Figures 2 and 3 and Appendix Figures 1 and 2 in the original guideline document), more likely to benefit from tamoxifen or raloxifene. The USPSTF found that the benefits of tamoxifen and raloxifene for breast cancer risk reduction are no greater than small in women who are not at increased risk for the disease. </li>
    <li>In addition to breast cancer risk reduction, the USPSTF found adequate evidence that tamoxifen and raloxifene reduce the risk for nonvertebral and vertebral fractures, respectively, in postmenopausal women. </li>

    <li>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found adequate evidence that tamoxifen and raloxifene increase risk for venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) by 4 to 7 events per 1000 women over 5 years and that tamoxifen increases risk more than raloxifene (refer to Appendix Table 3 in the original guideline document). The USPSTF found that potential harms from thromboembolic events are small to moderate, with increased potential for harms in older women. </li>
    <li>The USPSTF also found adequate evidence that tamoxifen but not raloxifene increases risk for endometrial cancer (4 more cases per 1000 women). Potential harms from tamoxifen-related endometrial cancer are small to moderate and depend on hysterectomy status and age. The potential risks for tamoxifen-related harms are higher in women older than 50 years and in women with a uterus. Tamoxifen may also increase the incidence of cataracts. </li>
    <li>Vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes), a common adverse effect of both medications that is not typically classified as serious, may affect a patient's quality of life and willingness to use or adhere to these medications. </li>

    <li>The USPSTF recognizes that clinical decisions involve more considerations than evidence alone.

    <field fieldid="131" ordby="1010" id="436" name="Description of Implementation Strategy" type="text">
      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The experiences of the first and second U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), as well as that of other evidence-based guideline efforts, have highlighted the importance of identifying effective ways to implement clinical recommendations. Practice guidelines are relatively weak tools for changing clinical practice when used in isolation. To effect change, guidelines must be coupled with strategies to improve their acceptance and feasibility. Such strategies include enlisting the support of local opinion leaders, using reminder systems for clinicians and patients, adopting standing orders, and audit and feedback of information to clinicians about their compliance with recommended practice.</p>
<p>In the case of preventive services guidelines, implementation needs to go beyond traditional dissemination and promotion efforts to recognize the added patient and clinician barriers that affect preventive care. These include clinicians' ambivalence about whether preventive medicine is part of their job, the psychological and practical challenges that patients face in changing behaviors, lack of access to health care or of insurance coverage for preventive services for some patients, competing pressures within the context of shorter office visits, and the lack of organized systems in most practices to ensure the delivery of recommended preventive care.</p>
<p>Dissemination strategies have changed dramatically in this age of electronic information. While recognizing the continuing value of journals and other print formats for dissemination, the USPSTF Task Force will make all its products available through its <a href=&quot;http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/&quot; title=&quot;USPSTF Web site&quot;>Web site</a>. The combination of electronic access and extensive material in the public domain should make it easier for a broad audience of users to access USPSTF materials and adapt them for their local needs. Online access to USPSTF products also opens up new possibilities for the appearance of the annual, pocket-size Guide to Clinical Preventive Services.</p>
<p>To be successful, approaches for implementing prevention have to be tailored to the local level and deal with the specific barriers at a given site, typically requiring the redesign of systems of care. Such a systems approach to prevention has had notable success in established staff-model health maintenance organizations, by addressing organization of care, emphasizing a philosophy of prevention, and altering the training and incentives for clinicians. Staff-model plans also benefit from integrated information systems that can track the use of needed services and generate automatic reminders aimed at patients and clinicians, some of the most consistently successful interventions. Information systems remain a major challenge for individual clinicians' offices, however, as well as for looser affiliations of practices in network-model managed care and independent practice associations, where data on patient visits, referrals, and test results are not always centralized.</p></div>"/>
