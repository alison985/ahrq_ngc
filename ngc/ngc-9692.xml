        <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-roman;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
            <li>Adult medical, surgical, and trauma intensive care unit (ICU) patients routinely experience pain, both at rest and with routine ICU care. <strong>(B)</strong> </li>
            <li>Pain in adult cardiac surgery patients is common and poorly treated; women experience more pain than men after cardiac surgery. <strong>(B)</strong> </li>
            <li>Procedural pain is common in adult ICU patients. <strong>(B)</strong> </li>

        <li>Pain assessment
        <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-roman;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
            <li>The task force recommends that pain be routinely monitored in all adult ICU patients. <strong>(+1B)</strong> </li>
            <li>The Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS) and the Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) are the most valid and reliable behavioral pain scales for monitoring pain in medical, postoperative, or trauma (except for brain injury) adult ICU patients who are unable to self-report and in whom motor function is intact and behaviors are observable. Using these scales in other ICU patient populations and translating them into foreign languages other than French or English require further validation testing. <strong>(B)</strong> </li>
            <li>The task force does not suggest that vital signs (or observational pain scales that include vital signs) be used alone for pain assessment in adult ICU patients. <strong>(&amp;ndash;2C)</strong> </li>
            <li>The task force suggests that vital signs may be used as a cue to begin further assessment of pain in these patients, however. <strong>(+2C)</strong> </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot; start=&quot;3&quot;>
        <li>Treatment of pain
        <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-roman;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
            <li>The task force recommends that preemptive analgesia and/or nonpharmacologic interventions (e.g., relaxation) be administered to alleviate pain in adult ICU patients prior to chest tube removal. <strong>(+1C)</strong> </li>
            <li>The task force suggests that for other types of invasive and potentially painful procedures in adult ICU patients, preemptive analgesic therapy and/or nonpharmacologic interventions may also be administered to alleviate pain. <strong>(+2C)</strong> </li>
            <li>The task force recommends that intravenous (IV) opioids be considered as the first-line drug class of choice to treat non-neuropathic pain in critically ill patients. <strong>(+1C)</strong> </li>
            <li>All available IV opioids, when titrated to similar pain intensity endpoints, are equally effective. <strong>(C)</strong> </li>
            <li>The task force suggests that nonopioid analgesics be considered to decrease the amount of opioids administered (or to eliminate the need for IV opioids altogether) and to decrease opioid-related side effects. <strong>(+2C)</strong> </li>
            <li>The task force recommends that either enterally administered gabapentin or carbamazepine, in addition to IV opioids, be considered for treatment of neuropathic pain. <strong>(+1A)</strong> </li>
            <li>The task force recommends that thoracic epidural anesthesia/analgesia be considered for postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery. <strong>(+1B)</strong> </li>
            <li>The task force provides no recommendation for using a lumbar epidural over parenteral opioids for postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery, due to a lack of benefit of epidural over parenteral opioids in this patient population. <strong>(0, A)</strong> </li>
            <li>The task force provides no recommendation for the use of thoracic epidural analgesia in patients undergoing either intrathoracic or nonvascular abdominal surgical procedures, due to insufficient and conflicting evidence for this mode of analgesic delivery in these patients. <strong>(0, B)</strong> </li>
            <li>The task force suggests that thoracic epidural analgesia be considered for patients with traumatic rib fractures. <strong>(+2B)</strong> </li>
            <li>The task force provides no recommendation for neuraxial/regional analgesia over systemic analgesia in medical ICU patients, due to lack of evidence in this patient population. <strong>(0, No Evidence)</strong> </li>

        <li>Depth of sedation vs. clinical outcomes
        <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-roman;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
            <li>Maintaining light levels of sedation in adult ICU patients is associated with improved clinical outcomes (e.g., shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and a shorter ICU length of stay [LOS]). <strong>(B)</strong> </li>
            <li>Maintaining light levels of sedation increases the physiologic stress response, but is not associated with an increased incidence of myocardial ischemia. <strong>(B)</strong> </li>
            <li>The association between depth of sedation and psychological stress in these patients remains unclear. <strong>(C)</strong> </li>
            <li>The task force recommends that sedative medications be titrated to maintain a light rather than a deep level of sedation in adult ICU patients, unless clinically contraindicated. <strong>(+1B)</strong> </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot; start=&quot;2&quot;>
        <li>Monitoring depth of sedation and brain function
        <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-roman;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
            <li>The Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) and Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS) are the most valid and reliable sedation assessment tools for measuring quality and depth of sedation in adult ICU patients. <strong>(B)</strong> </li>
            <li>The task force does not recommend that objective measures of brain function (e.g., auditory evoked potentials [AEPs], Bispectral Index [BIS], Narcotrend Index [NI], Patient State Index [PSI], or state entropy [SE]) be used as the primary method to monitor depth of sedation in noncomatose, nonparalyzed critically ill adult patients, as these monitors are inadequate substitutes for subjective sedation scoring systems. <strong>(&amp;ndash;1B)</strong> </li>
            <li>The task force suggests that objective measures of brain function (e.g., AEPs, BIS, NI, PSI, or SE) be used as an adjunct to subjective sedation assessments in adult ICU patients who are receiving neuromuscular blocking agents, as subjective sedation assessments may be unobtainable in these patients. <strong>(+2B)</strong> </li>
            <li>The task force recommends that electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring be used to monitor nonconvulsive seizure activity in adult ICU patients with either known or suspected seizures, or to titrate electrosuppressive medication to achieve burst suppression in adult ICU patients with elevated intracranial pressure. <strong>(+1A)</strong> </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot; start=&quot;3&quot;>
        <li>Choice of sedative
        <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-roman;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
            <li>The task force suggests that sedation strategies using nonbenzodiazepine sedatives (either propofol or dexmedetomidine) may be preferred over sedation with benzodiazepines (either midazolam or lorazepam) to improve clinical outcomes in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients. <strong>(+2B)</strong> </li>
        </ol>

        <li>Outcomes associated with delirium
        <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-roman;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
            <li>Delirium is associated with increased mortality in adult ICU patients. <strong>(A)</strong> </li>
            <li>Delirium is associated with prolonged ICU and hospital LOS in adult ICU patients. <strong>(A)</strong> </li>
            <li>Delirium is associated with the development of post-ICU cognitive impairment in adult ICU patients. <strong>(B)</strong> </li>

        <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-roman;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
            <li>The task force recommends routine monitoring of delirium in adult ICU patients. <strong>(+1B)</strong> </li>
            <li>The Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) and the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) are the most valid and reliable delirium monitoring tools in adult ICU patients. <strong>(A)</strong> </li>
            <li>Routine monitoring of delirium in adult ICU patients is feasible in clinical practice. <strong>(B)</strong> </li>
        </ol>

<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>b</sup> RCTs with significant limitations: 1) study design limitations (planning, implementation bias); 2) inconsistency of results; 3) indirectness of evidence; 4) imprecision of results; 5) high likelihood of reporting bias.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;><sup>c</sup> High-quality OS: 1) large magnitude of treatment effect; 2) evidence of a dose-response relationship; 3) plausible biases would decrease the magnitude of an apparent treatment effect.</p>
<p><strong>Levels of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>A <strong>strong recommendation</strong> either in favor of (+1) or against (&amp;ndash;1) an intervention implied that the majority of task force members believed that the benefits of the intervention significantly outweighed the risks (or vice versa) and that the majority of patients and providers would pursue this course of action (or not), given the choice.</p>
<p>A <strong>weak recommendation</strong> either in favor of (+2) or against (&amp;ndash;2) an intervention implied that the benefits of the intervention likely outweighed the risks (or vice versa), but that task force members were not confident about these trade-offs, either because of a low quality of evidence or because the trade-offs between risks and benefits were closely balanced. On the basis of this information, most people might pursue this course of action (or not), but a significant number of patients and providers would choose an alternative course of action.</p>
<p>A <strong>no recommendation</strong> (0) could also be made due to either a lack of evidence or a lack of consensus among subcommittee members.</p></div>"/>

Search parameters included published (or in press) English-only manuscripts on adult humans (&amp;gt;18 yr), from December 1999 (the search limit for the 2002 guidelines) through December 2010. Studies with less than 30 patients, editorials, narrative reviews, case reports, animal or in vitro studies, and letters to the editor were excluded. Biweekly automated searches were continued beyond this date, and relevant articles were incorporated into the guidelines through July 2012, but studies published after December 2010 were not included in the evidence review and voting process. The 2002 guideline references were also included in the database, and targeted searches of the literature published before December 1999 were performed as needed.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The statements and recommendations in the 2012 version of the guidelines were developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, a structured system for rating quality of evidence and grading strength of recommendation in clinical practice (<a href=&quot;http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org&quot; title=&quot;GRADE Web site&quot;>http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org</a>). Subcommittees worked with members of the GRADE Working Group to phrase all clinical questions in either &quot;descriptive&quot; or &quot;actionable&quot; terms. They structured actionable questions in the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes format and classified clinical outcomes related to each intervention as critical, important, or unimportant to clinical decision making. Only important and critical outcomes were included in the evidence review, and only critical outcomes were included in developing recommendations. Subcommittee members searched the database for relevant articles and uploaded corresponding Portable Document Format (PDFs) to facilitate group review. Two subcommittee members independently completed a GRADE evidence profile summarizing the findings of each study and evaluated the quality of evidence. The quality of evidence was judged to be high (level A), moderate (level B), or low/very low (level C), based on both study design and specific study characteristics, which could result in a reviewer either downgrading or upgrading the quality of the evidence (see Table 1 of the original guideline document [see the &quot;Guideline Availability&quot; field]). If multiple studies related to a particular outcome demonstrated disparate results, and no published systematic reviews on the topic existed, a meta-analysis of the relevant literature was performed by a member of the GRADE Working Group.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Subcommittees collectively reviewed the evidence profiles for each question, and using a nominal group technique, determined the overall quality of evidence (for both descriptive and actionable questions), the strength of recommendation (for actionable questions only), and drafted evidence summaries for review by other task force members. The strength of recommendations was defined as either strong (1) or weak (2), and either for (+) or against (&amp;ndash;) an intervention, based on both the quality of evidence and the risks and benefits across all critical outcomes (Table 2 of the original guideline document). A no recommendation (0) could also be made due to either a lack of evidence or a lack of consensus among subcommittee members. Consensus statements based on expert opinion alone were not used when evidence could not support a recommendation. A strong recommendation either in favor of (+1) or against (&amp;ndash;1) an intervention implied that the majority of task force members believed that the benefits of the intervention significantly outweighed the risks (or vice versa) and that the majority of patients and providers would pursue this course of action (or not), given the choice. A weak recommendation either in favor of (+2) or against (&amp;ndash;2) an intervention implied that the benefits of the intervention likely outweighed the risks (or vice versa), but that task force members were not confident about these tradeoffs, either because of a low quality of evidence or because the trade-offs between risks and benefits were closely balanced. On the basis of this information, most people might pursue this course of action (or not), but a significant number of patients and providers would choose an alternative course of action. Throughout these guidelines, for all strong recommendations, the phrase &quot;The task force recommends &amp;hellip;&quot; was used, and for all weak recommendations, &quot;The task force suggests &amp;hellip;&quot; was used.</p>
<p>Group consensus for all statements and recommendations was achieved using a modified Delphi method with an anonymous voting scheme. Task force members reviewed the subcommittees' Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Evidence Summaries, and statements and recommendations, and voted and commented anonymously on each statement and recommendation using an on-line electronic survey tool. Consensus on the strength of evidence for each question required a majority (&amp;gt;50%) vote. Consensus on the strength of recommendations was defined as follows: a recommendation in favor of an intervention (or the comparator) required at least 50% of all task force members voting in favor, with less than 20% voting against; failure to meet these voting thresholds resulted in no recommendation being made. For a recommendation to be graded as strong rather than weak, at least 70% of those voting had to vote for a strong recommendation, otherwise it received a weak recommendation. Polling results and comments were then summarized and distributed to all pain, agitation, and delirium (PAD) guideline task force members for review. When one round of voting failed to produce group consensus, additional discussion and a second and/or third round of voting occurred.</p></div>"/>

<p>Closing the gap between the evidence highlighted in these guidelines and intensive care unit (ICU) practice will be a significant challenge for ICU clinicians and is best accomplished using a multifaceted, interdisciplinary approach. The recommendations supported by clinical practice guidelines should be adapted to local practice patterns and resource availability, and used as a template for institution-specific protocols and order sets. Successful implementation will require augmentation with education, engagement of local thought leaders, point-of-use reminders, and caregiver-specific practice feedback, together with continuous protocol evaluation and modification. Incorporating electronically based guidelines into clinical decision-support tools may facilitate bedside knowledge transfer and application. To support this effort, the guideline developers have developed a pocket card summarizing these guideline recommendations (Figure 2 in the original guideline document), and a template for a pain, agitation, and delirium (PAD) care bundle (Figure 3 in the original guideline document).</p></div>"/>
