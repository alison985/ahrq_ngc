<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Influenza Immunization: Adult Patients with Cancer</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Annual administration of the <strong>inactivated</strong> influenza vaccine is indicated for all adult patients with cancer. Patients considered to be the highest priority are those on active treatment; the next priority group includes patients who have been treated within the past one year. Current recommendations do not support the administration of a second dose of vaccine in adults during the same influenza season (National Advisory Committee on Immunization [NACI], 2012; Alberta Health Services Immunization Program, 2013; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2013). </li>
    <li>The 2013/2014 trivalent influenza vaccine contains the following antigenic strains: A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus, A(H3N2) virus antigenically like the cell-propagated prototype virus A/Victoria/361/2011 (A/Texas/50/2012 viruses, which are antigenically like the A/Victoria/361/2011, will be used in manufacturing the vaccine), and B/Massachusetts/2/2012-like virus (Yamagata lineage) (Alberta Health Services Immunization Program, 2013; CDC, 2013). </li>
    <li>Age, type and duration of systemic therapy, and curative versus palliative treatment intent do not appear to influence the response of adult patients with cancer to the influenza immunization. Adult patients with hematologic malignancies may have lower responses to immunization when compared to adult patients with solid tumours. </li>
    <li>Ideally, influenza vaccine should be given at least 10 to 14 days before the start of any immune-suppressing cancer treatment, to allow for sufficient antibody production by the patient. If the patient is actively receiving chemotherapy, the vaccine should be ideally administered when blood counts are near the normal range. If this is not possible, the patient can still be immunized during a course of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, based on individual clinical judgment incorporating a patient's overall clinical situation. </li>
    <li>For adult patients undergoing blood and marrow transplant (BMT, autologous and allogeneic):
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
        <li>The inactivated influenza vaccine should be administered at least 10 to 14 days prior to harvest (allogeneic donor), in the first half of the interval between mobilization chemotherapy and harvest (autologous recipient), or at least 10 to 14 days prior to transplant conditioning (allogeneic recipient). <strong>Live vaccines are contraindicated.</strong> </li>
        <li>Immune system recovery post-BMT is variable and requires physician assessment. Between 10% and 30% of BMT recipients will have a detectable antibody response to the influenza vaccine at 6 to 24 months post-transplant, while over 60% will have a detectable response at 24 months or more post-transplant. </li>
        <li>For hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, influenza vaccine should ideally be administered 6 months post-HSCT. Upon physician request only, influenza vaccine can be given as early as 4 months post-transplant; however, if given less than 6 months post-transplant a second dose can be given if there is ongoing circulation of influenza virus in the community. </li>
        <li>Close contacts of BMT patients should be strongly encouraged to be immunized annually against influenza (Government of Alberta, 2013; Ljungman et al., 2009) </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Immunization of family members and hospital or clinic staff who are in contact with adult patients with cancer is strongly recommended. In many cases, this may be more important than immunizing the patients themselves, as some patients may be less likely to respond to the vaccine. It is important for transplant recipients to know that people receiving the live nasal spray influenza vaccine virus can shed vaccine virus in small amounts which are generally below the levels needed to spread vaccine virus to others. In rare cases, vaccine virus can be spread from vaccine recipients to unimmunized people but is not likely to cause illness. However, it is recommended that anyone who has a severely weakened immune system (e.g., bone marrow transplant recipients requiring isolation) avoid contact with people who have received the live nasal spray influenza vaccine for a time period of two weeks.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Family members of and hospital staff working with severely immune suppressed individuals in a protected environment should receive the <strong>inactivated</strong> annual influenza vaccine. </li>
    <li>Contraindications and precautions for influenza immunization in adult patients with cancer are:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>A previous anaphylactic reaction to an influenza vaccine </li>
        <li>A known hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine </li>
        <li>A history of severe oculo-respiratory syndrome that included lower respiratory symptoms within 24 hours of receiving the influenza vaccine, pending consultation with the Medical Officer of Health to review the risks and benefits of further immunization </li>
        <li>A history of developing Guillain-Barr&amp;eacute; syndrome within 6 weeks of a previous dose of influenza vaccine </li>
        <li>Individuals with severe acute febrile illness should not be immunized until the symptoms have resolved; individuals with mild-to-moderate febrile illness may be immunized </li>
        <li>Egg-allergic individuals may be immunized using the inactivated annual influenza vaccine without prior influenza skin test and with the full dose of vaccine with the following conditions:
        <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
            <li>Egg-allergic individuals who have experienced anaphylaxis with respiratory or cardiovascular symptoms should be immunized in a medical clinic, allergist's office or hospital where appropriate expertise and equipment to manage respiratory or cardiovascular compromise is present. These individuals should be kept under observation for 30 minutes. </li>
            <li>Egg-allergic individuals with mild reactions such as hives, or those who tolerate eggs in baked goods may be immunized in regular immunization clinics and should be kept under observation for 30 minutes following immunization. </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Influenza Immunization: Pediatric Patients with Cancer</span></strong></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Annual administration of the <strong>inactivated</strong> influenza vaccine is indicated for all pediatric patients with cancer who are 6 months of age and older. Immunization with currently available influenza vaccines is <strong>not</strong> recommended for infants younger than 6 months of age. The recommended doses by age are as follows:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Children 9 years or older should receive one dose of influenza vaccine. </li>
        <li>Previously unvaccinated children who are older than 6 months and less than 9 years of age require <strong>two</strong> doses of influenza vaccine in the first year they are immunized, with a minimum interval of 4 weeks between doses. </li>
        <li>A full dose of influenza vaccine should be used for all persons, including children 6 to 35 months of age, who are receiving influenza immunization. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Although the data is limited, age and type and duration of systemic therapy do not appear to influence the response of pediatric patients to influenza vaccine. Pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies may have lower responses to immunization when compared to pediatric patients with solid tumours. </li>
    <li>Current recommendations for pediatric patients with cancer suggest that influenza vaccine should ideally be given at least 10 to 14 days before the start of the next round of chemotherapy, to allow the patient to develop a sufficient antibody response. If the patient is actively receiving chemotherapy or radiation treatment, the vaccine should be ideally administered when blood counts are near the normal range. If this is not possible, the patient can still be immunized during a course of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, based on individual clinical judgment incorporating a patient's overall clinical situation. </li>
    <li>For pediatric patients undergoing BMT (autologous and allogeneic):
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
        <li>Administer the inactivated influenza vaccine at least 10 to 14 days prior to harvest (allogeneic donor), in the first half of the interval between mobilization chemotherapy and harvest (autologous recipient), or at least 10 to 14 days prior to transplant conditioning (allogeneic recipient). <strong>The live nasal spray influenza vaccine is contraindicated.</strong> </li>
        <li>Immune system recovery post-BMT is variable and requires physician assessment. Between 10% and 30% of BMT recipients will have a detectable antibody response to the influenza vaccine at 6 to 24 months post-transplant, while over 60% will have a detectable response at 24 months or more post-transplant. </li>
        <li>For HSCT recipients influenza vaccine should ideally be administered 6 months post-HSCT. Upon physician request only influenza vaccine can be given as early as 4 months post-transplant, however, if given less than 6 months post-transplant a second dose can be given if there is ongoing circulation of influenza virus in the community. </li>
        <li>Close contacts of pediatric BMT patients should be strongly encouraged to be immunized annually against influenza. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Annual influenza immunization of family members, out-of-home caregivers, and hospital or clinic staff in contact with pediatric patients with cancer is strongly recommended. In many cases, this may be more important than immunizing the patient themselves, as some patients may be less likely to respond to the vaccine. It is important for transplant recipients to know that people receiving the live nasal spray influenza vaccine virus can shed vaccine virus in small amounts which are generally below the levels needed to spread vaccine virus to others. In rare cases vaccine virus can be spread from vaccine recipients to unimmunized people but is not likely to cause illness. However, it is recommended that anyone who has a severely weakened immune system (e.g., bone marrow transplant recipients requiring isolation) avoid contact with people who have received the live nasal spray influenza vaccine for a time period of 2 weeks.</p>

        <li>A previous anaphylactic reaction to an influenza vaccine </li>

            <li>Children who are to receive a second influenza vaccine dose during the same season can, if the first dose was tolerated well, be given a single dose of the same product; a graded process is not needed for the second dose. </li>

    <li>What is the best timing for administering the influenza vaccine in relation to the therapy cycle? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>For the original guideline published in 2009, the MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases were searched. The search included practice guidelines, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and clinical trials published between 1965 and October 2009. Websites from health organizations including the World Health Organization, Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, Alberta Health Services, Alberta Health and Wellness, the BC Cancer Agency, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Guideline Clearinghouse, and the D&amp;eacute;partement D'Oncologie P&amp;eacute;diatrique (France) were also searched for relevant guidance. The search terms for influenza immunization included: influenza vaccine or H1N1 vaccine AND neoplasms or radiotherapy or therapy or surgery or drug therapy. The search terms for immunocompromised patients included influenza vaccine or H1N1 vaccine AND cancer or oncology AND immunocompromise*.</p>
<p>For subsequent annual guideline updates, the PubMed and Cochrane databases were searched for publications limited to the previous one-year date range, using the search terms &quot;cancer&quot; OR &quot;neoplasm&quot; OR &quot;oncology&quot; AND &quot;influenza vaccination&quot; OR &quot;H1N1&quot; OR &quot;H3N2&quot; OR &quot;influenza A&quot; OR &quot;influenza B&quot;.</p></div>"/>

<p><strong>Evidence Tables</strong></p>
<p>Evidence tables containing the first author, year of publication, patient group/stage of disease, methodology, and main outcomes of interest are assembled using the studies identified in the literature search.

<p>The working group members formulated the guideline recommendations based on the evidence synthesized by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist during the planning process, blended with expert clinical interpretation of the evidence. As detailed in the <a href=&quot;http://www.albertahealthservices.ca/hp/if-hp-cancer-guide-utilization-handbook.pdf&quot; title=&quot;Alberta Health Service Web site&quot;>Guideline Utilization Resource Unit Handbook</a> (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field), the working group members may decide to adopt the recommendations of another institution without any revisions, adapt the recommendations of another institution or institutions to better reflect local practices, or develop their own set of recommendations by adapting some, but not all, recommendations from different guidelines.</p>
<p>The degree to which a recommendation is based on expert opinion of the working group and/or the Provincial Tumour Team members is explicitly stated in the guideline recommendations. Similar to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) methodology for formulating guideline recommendations, the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU) does not use formal rating schemes for describing the strength of the recommendations, but rather describes, in conventional and explicit language, the type and quality of the research and existing guidelines that were taken into consideration when formulating the recommendations.</p></div>"/>

<p>When the draft guideline document has been completed, revised, and reviewed by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist and the working group members, it will be sent to all members of the Provincial Tumour Team for review and comment. This step ensures that those intended to use the guideline have the opportunity to review the document and identify potential difficulties for implementation before the guideline is finalized. Depending on the size of the document, and the number of people it is sent to for review, a deadline of one to two weeks will usually be given to submit any feedback. Ideally, this review will occur prior to the annual Provincial Tumour Team meeting, and a discussion of the proposed edits will take place at the meeting. The working group members will then make final revisions to the document based on the received feedback, as appropriate. Once the guideline is finalized, it will be officially endorsed by the Provincial Tumour Team Lead and the Executive Director of Provincial Tumour Programs.</p></div>"/>

    <li>It is important for transplant recipients to know that people receiving the live nasal spray influenza vaccine virus can shed vaccine virus in small amounts which are generally below the levels needed to spread vaccine virus to others. In rare cases, vaccine virus can be spread from vaccine recipients to unimmunized people but is not likely to cause illness. However, it is recommended that anyone who has a severely weakened immune system (e.g., bone marrow transplant recipients requiring isolation) avoid contact with people who have received the live nasal spray influenza vaccine for a time period of 2 weeks. </li>
    <li>Egg-allergic individuals who have experienced anaphylaxis with respiratory or cardiovascular symptoms should be immunized in a medical clinic, allergist's office or hospital where appropriate expertise and equipment to manage respiratory or cardiovascular compromise is present. These individuals should be kept under observation for 30 minutes. </li>
    <li>Egg-allergic individuals with mild reactions such as hives, or those who tolerate eggs in baked goods, may be immunized in regular immunization clinics and should be kept under observation for 30 minutes following immunization. </li>
