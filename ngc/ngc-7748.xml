	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

Any aspects that the authors of the guideline considered worth highlighting as an area in which conclusive evidence was lacking, or because it addressed particularly relevant clinical aspects are marked as good practice points (<strong>GPP</strong>). New recommendations and those substantially modified with regard to the guideline's previous versions are marked with the year (<strong>2007</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Initial Evaluation of Hypertensive Patients</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Screening for Arterial Hypertension (AHT)</strong></p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: Screening by means of an opportunist AHT strategy through periodic measuring of the clinical blood pressure (BP) is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: Following the Program of Preventive Activities and of Promotion of Health (PAPPS) recommendations concerning AHT screening is advised: measuring BP at least once before reaching 14 years of age; every 4 or 5 years after 14 years of age until 40, and every 2 years from 40 years of age, taking advantage of occasional consultations.</p>
<p><strong>GPP</strong>: The BP measurements in health care centers are preferably taken by the nursing staff.</p>
<p><strong>Definition and Classification of AHT according to BP Numbers and Cardiovascular Risk</strong></p>
<p><strong>D (2007)</strong>: Pharmacological treatment of level-1 AHT with target organ affection regardless of cardiovascular risk is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: The use of the Registre Gironi del Cor (REGICOR) tables in the calculation of coronary risk in hypertensive patients is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: Pharmacological treatment of level-1 AHT with coronary risk &amp;ge;10% according to the REGICOR table is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: Patients with level-1 AHT with coronary risk &amp;lt;10% must be considered for pharmacological treatment depending on other additional risk factors.</p>
<p><strong>D (2007)</strong>: Patients with level-1 AHT with low coronary risk (&amp;lt;10%) and without other additional risk factors, must be treated with non-pharmacological measures for a year, after which the need for pharmacological treatment must be re-evaluated.</p>
<p><strong>AHT Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p><em>Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (AMPM): Normal Values and Indications</em></p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: The ABPM must be conducted with independently validated instruments according to the international standards of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), of the British Hypertension Society (BHS) or European Society of Hypertension (ESH).</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: The ABPM is a method that can be useful in the diagnosis of AHT since its increase is correlated with cardiovascular morbimortality.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: The mean BP numbers over a period of <strong>24 h</strong> measured by means of ABPM that define a person as hypertensive are SBP &amp;ge;135 mm Hg and DBP &amp;ge;80 mm Hg.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: The mean <strong>daytime</strong> BP numbers measured by means of ABPM that define a person as hypertensive are SBP &amp;ge;135 mm Hg and DBP &amp;ge;85 mm Hg.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: The mean <strong>night time</strong> BP numbers measured by means of ABPM that define a person as hypertensive are SBP &amp;ge;120 mm Hg and DBP &amp;ge;75 mm Hg.</p>
<p><em>Self-Measurement of Blood Pressure (SMBP): Normal Values and Indications</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: The SMBP must be done independently with instruments validated according to the international standards of the AAMI, BHS or ESH.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: The SMBP is a method that can be useful in the diagnosis of AHT, since the values obtained by means of this technique are correlated to cardiovascular morbimortality.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: The BP numbers measured by SMBP that define a patient as hypertensive are systolic blood pressure (SBP) &amp;ge;135 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &amp;ge;85 mmHg.</p>
<p><em>Number of BP Readings Necessary with SMBP</em></p>
<p><strong>D (2007)</strong>: When the SMBP is used for diagnostic purposes, a minimum schedule of BP self measurements of at least three days with the readings taken every 12 hours is advised. The readings of the first day may not be taken into consideration.</p>
<p><strong>D (2007)</strong>: When the SMBP is used in the monitoring of the hypertensive patient, a minimum schedule of BP self-measurements on three days with three readings taken every 12 hours during the week prior to the medical consultation is advised.</p>
<p><em>SMBP in the Diagnosis of Isolated Clinical Hypertension or White Coat AHT</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: When the SMBP is used in light of the suspicion of white coat hypertension (WCH), the findings of some numbers higher than 145/95 mm Hg diagnose a hypertensive person, while lower numbers require conducting an ABPM.</p>
<p><em>Clinical Significance of WCH</em></p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: The monitoring of WCH must include non-pharmacological measures and the periodic evaluation of cardiovascular risk and of target organ affection.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: Patients with isolated clinical AHT must be controlled by taking their BP in the doctor's office and by ABPM, if necessary, to identify its possible evolution to maintained AHT.</p>
<p><strong>Initial Study of the Hypertensive Patient</strong></p>
<p><em>Measuring Microalbuminuria in the Hypertensive Patient</em></p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: Measuring the albumin/creatinine ratio in hypertensive patients in stage 1 is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>D (2007)</strong>: Conducting an echocardiogram is not recommended as initial study in all hypertensive patients.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: The initial study of the hypertensive patient is comprised by the physical cardiovascular examination, blood analysis (haemogram, glycaemia, creatinine, sodium, potassium, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein [HDL], low-density lipoprotein [LDL], sediment and albumin/creatinine ratio), ocular fundus and electrocardiography (ECG).</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring Proposal</strong></p>
<p><em>Target Numbers</em></p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: SBP numbers &amp;lt;140 mm Hg and DBP &amp;lt;90 mm Hg are recommended as the target of the treatment of the hypertensive patient.</p>
<p><em>Frequency of Controls</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: A half-yearly consultation is proposed to monitor hypertensive patients, once the target objective has been achieved.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: In some patients selected according to their cardiovascular risk, target organ affection or compliance, this frequency can be quarterly.</p>
<p><em>Pharmacological Therapeutic Compliance</em></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: The antihypertensive pharmacological treatment has to be in a single daily dose whenever possible.</p>
<p><strong>B (2007)</strong>: The health care professionals that treat the hypertensive patients must use different combined strategies that go beyond brief advice in order to improve the pharmacological therapeutic compliance.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Simplifying the dosage guidelines (reduction of dosage, combination of drugs in a single tablet, etc.) in order to enhance compliance of antihypertensive treatments is recommended.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Treatment of Hypertensive Patients</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Non-pharmacological Measures in the Treatment of AHT</strong></p>
<p><em>Consumption of Salt</em></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: The patients with essential AHT must receive professional advice in order to decrease the sodium content of the diet. This advice must be given even to those patients that follow a heart-healthy diet. This advice is especially important in the population over 45 years of age.</p>
<p><em>Physical Exercise</em></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Hypertensive patients should receive advice through interventions structured on the practice of physical exercise of aerobic intensity adapted to their characteristics. The exercise should include, at least, three weekly sessions of 45-60 minutes of duration.</p>
<p><em>Weight Control</em></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: The patients with essential AHT, including those that take antihypertensive drugs, must receive advice from the professionals on losing weight.</p>
<p><em>Stress Control</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: Controlling stress is not recommended as a general measure for the treatment of AHT.</p>
<p><em>Consumption of Alcohol</em></p>
<p><strong>A (2007)</strong>: Hypertensive excessive drinkers must receive advice on reducing alcohol consumption. The objective is to reduce the intake of alcohol by at least 60%.</p>
<p><strong>B/D</strong>: Male hypertensive drinkers who consume amounts less than 17 units/week of alcohol do not require changes in their habits because of the possible cardioprotective effect of the moderate consumption of alcohol <strong>(B)</strong>. This limit will be 11 units/week for women <strong>(D)</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Consumption of Potassium</em></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: A diet rich in fruit and vegetables with high potassium content is recommended for all patients with hypertension. Potassium supplements, after an individualized evaluation, can be recommended to some patients.</p>
<p><em>Consumption of Calcium and Magnesium</em></p>
<p><strong>A (2007)</strong>: Neither calcium or magnesium supplements are generally recommended for hypertensive patients.</p>
<p><em>Consumption of Omega-3 Fatty Acids</em></p>
<p><strong>B (2007)</strong>: The inclusion in the diet of food rich in Omega-3 fatty acids such as high-oil fish (3 times a week) can be recommended.</p>
<p><em>Consumption of Fibre</em></p>
<p><strong>B (2007)</strong>: The consumption of fibre in the diet is recommended, the same as for the general population.</p>
<p><em>Consumption of Coffee</em></p>
<p><strong>B (2007)</strong>: It is not necessary to eliminate coffee in the diet of hypertensive patients; only the consumption of more than five cups a day can have effects on BP.</p>
<p><em>Life-Style Changes: Combination of Several Non-pharmacological Measures</em></p>
<p><strong>A (2007)</strong>: The combination of non-pharmacological measures is not effective in decreasing BP numbers.</p>
<p><strong>D (2007)</strong>: The complexity of complying with it requires it to be proposed individually.</p>
<p><em>Educational or the Organization's Interventions</em></p>
<p><strong>A (2007)</strong>: The organized care of hypertensive patients that also includes educational interventions and promotion of self-care is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Pharmacological Treatment of AHT in Patients with No Associated Disease</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: The treatment of hypertension is recommended independently of gender. With respect to age, it seems to be consistent in treating both young persons and adults under 80 years of age.</p>
<p><em>Diuretics</em></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: In the initial treatment of uncomplicated AHT, thiazide diuretics at low doses are the drugs of first choice ahead of the remainder of the families of antihypertensives (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs], angiotensin II receptor antagonists [ARAs II], and calcium antagonists), in young hypertensive patients as well as those of a more advanced age and in isolated systolic AHT. They are also of choice in the initial treatment of hypertension in stages 1 and 2 associated with an additional risk factor.</p>
<p><em>Beta Blockers</em></p>
<p><strong>A (2007)</strong>: The use of beta blockers is not recommended as front-line drugs in the initial treatment of uncomplicated AHT.</p>
<p><em>ACEI</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: ACEIs can be used as alternative drugs to the diuretics with uncomplicated AHT, and in absence of stenosis of the renal artery.</p>
<p><em>Calcium Antagonists</em></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Dihydropyridines are an effective alternative to thiazide diuretics for the treatment of isolated systolic AHT in patients over 60 years of age.</p>
<p><strong>B (2007)</strong>: Calcium antagonists can be an alternative treatment to the diuretics in uncomplicated hypertension.</p>
<p><em>Alpha Blockers</em></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: The alpha blockers are not recommended as treatment of first choice in single-drug therapy.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: The use of alpha blockers in association must be reserved for cases in which the other combinations of drugs have failed.</p>
<p><em>ARA II</em></p>
<p><strong>B (2007)</strong>: ARA II are not drugs of first choice in uncomplicated AHT, although they can be used as an alternative to the ACEIs in the case of intolerance.</p>
<p><em>Abandonment Because of Adverse Effects</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: It is necessary to take into account the profile of adverse effects in the choice of antihypertensive drugs.</p>
<p><strong>B (2007)</strong>: When antihypertensive associations are considered, the diuretics, beta blockers and calcium antagonists can be used at half the standard dosage in order to minimize the adverse effects, keeping the ACEIs and ARA II at the usual dosage.</p>
<p><em>Pharmacological Treatment of AHT in the Elderly</em></p>
<p><strong>A (2007)</strong>: In patients between 60-80 years, it is recommended to follow the general guidelines of the antihypertensive treatment.</p>
<p><strong>A (2007)</strong>: In patients &amp;ge;80 years with SBP &amp;ge;160 mm Hg, indapamide is recommended as initial pharmacological treatment, adding perindopril up to 4 mg if it is necessary to control the BP.</p>
<p><strong>D (2007)</strong>: In patients over 80 years of age, it is recommended to continue with the established treatments if they are well tolerated. In special situations the recommendations of the specific sections of this clinical practice guideline will be followed.</p>
<p><strong>Pharmacological Treatment in Special Situations</strong></p>
<p><em>Diabetes Mellitus without Nephropathy</em></p>
<p><strong>B/D (2007)</strong>: In the patients with essential AHT and Type 2 diabetes mellitus without nephropathy, treatment target numbers of SBP &amp;lt;140 mm Hg <strong>(D)</strong> and DBP &amp;lt;80 mm Hg <strong>(B)</strong> are recommended.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Pharmacological Treatment</span></p>
<p><strong>A (2007)</strong>: Thiazide diuretics or ACEIs are recommended as treatment of choice in hypertensive patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and the dihydropyridinic calcium antagonists and ARA II as alternative treatment.</p>
<p><strong>B (2007)</strong>: Beta blockers are not recommended in the diabetic hypertensive patient, unless there is a firm indication for their use, such as ischaemic cardiopathy or cardiac insufficiency.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: Elderly diabetic patients with isolated systolic AHT must be treated preferably with diuretics at low doses or with long-acting dihydropyridines (nitrendipine).</p>
<p><em>Diabetic Nephropathy</em></p>
<p><strong>D (2007)</strong>: Patients with AHT and diabetic nephropathy must receive treatment to lower their BP until achieving BP under 140/80 mmHg.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Pharmacological Treatment</span></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: The hypertensive patients with diabetes mellitus and nephropathy must be treated with an ACEI. ARA II is the alternative treatment.</p>
<p><em>Non-diabetic Nephropathy</em></p>
<p><strong>D (2007)</strong>: In patients with non-diabetic nephropathy and gross proteinuria (&amp;gt;1 g/day), keeping the BP under 130/80 mm Hg as long as they tolerate the treatment is recommended. In case of proteinuria &amp;lt;1 g/day the proposed numbers are 130/85 mm Hg.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Pharmacological Treatment</span></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: The use of ACEI is recommended as the initial treatment for hypertensive patients with non-diabetic nephropathy.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: In case of intolerance (secondary effects that require withdrawing the drug) of ACEIs, an ARA II is recommended as an alternative initial treatment.</p>
<p><strong>GPP</strong>: The ACEI or ARA II could be used whenever there is no bilateral stenosis of the renal arteries or unilateral stenosis in a single kidney.</p>
<p><strong>GPP</strong>: The combination of ACEI with ARA II can be useful in certain patients whose selection must be done in the specialized care area.</p>
<p><em>Congestive Cardiac Insufficiency (CCI)</em></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: All hypertensive patients with CCI independently of its aetiology or functional class should be treated with ACEIs, as long as they do not present contraindications and their use is tolerated. In patients that do not tolerate their use, an ARA II is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: All hypertensive patients with CCI in functional class II-IV, in stable phase and with previous standard treatment (ACEI, diuretics and/or digoxin) should be treated with beta blockers.</p>
<p><strong>GPP</strong>: The titration of the dosage of beta blockers should be done slowly and weekly to improve tolerance.</p>
<p><strong>GPP</strong>: The recommended beta blockers are: bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol retard, nebivolol.</p>
<p><strong>B* (2007)</strong>: The ACEI+ARA II combination (valsartan or candesartan) is recommended as an alternative in hypertensive patients with CCI in which beta blockers are not tolerated or are contraindicated.</p>
<p><strong>GPP (2007)</strong>: Monitoring of the adverse effects of the ACEI+ARA II combination (hypotension, hyperpotassemia and impairment of renal function) is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>B* (2007)</strong>: In case of poor control of AHT, despite optimizing the dosage of ACEI, beta blocker and diuretic, candesartan can be added.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: Dihydropyridines should not be used in hypertensive patients with CCI as part of the standard treatment.</p>
<p><strong>GPP</strong>: Only long-acting dihydropyridines (amlodipine, felodipine) should be used if additional drugs are needed to control the BP or as anti-anginal drugs.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*The recommendation level is decreased due to being an analysis of subgroups.</p>
<p><em>Ischaemic Cardiopathy</em></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Beta blockers are the drugs of choice in the treatment of AHT in hypertensive patients with a history of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).</p>
<p><strong>B*</strong>: Beta blockers are the drugs of choice in AHT treatment in patients with stable angina.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: All hypertensive patients with previous AMI with or without left ventricular systolic dysfunction must be treated with ACEIs if there is no contraindication or intolerance of them.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: An ARA II is recommended in all hypertensive patients with previous AMI and systolic dysfunction with intolerance of ACEIs.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: The calcium antagonists should not form part of the initial treatment in hypertensive treatments that have suffered an AMI. They are recommended only if they are necessary as part of the antihypertensive treatment in achieving the target BP.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: In all the patients with ischaemic cardiopathy and arterial hypertension, adding an ACEI to the treatment must be firmly considered.</p>
<p><strong>B (2007)</strong>: In hypertensive patients with ischaemic cardiopathy, calcium antagonists (verapamil, amlodipine and nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) can be used as an alternative to the beta blockers.</p>
<p><strong>B (2007)</strong>: If another drug is required to be added to the beta blocker in hypertensive patients with ischaemic cardiopathy (to control the symptoms or to achieve the BP target numbers), the use of a dihydropyridine is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: Immediate-release nifedipine should not be used in hypertensive patients with angina.</p>
<p><strong>GPP</strong>: If an ACEI is added to the hypertensive treatment with ischaemic cardiopathy, attempts should be made to reach the dosages used in the clinical trials (ramipril 10 mg, perindopril 8 mg), especially if the desired target BP has not been reached.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*It cannot be established conclusively that there are no differences between the beta blockers and the calcium antagonists as regards morbimortality.</p>
<p><em>Cerebrovascular Disease</em></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: All hypertensive patients that have suffered a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) must be treated with antihypertensives.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: The combination of indapamide with perindopril is appropriate for the treatment of hypertensive patients with previous CVA.</p>
<p><em>Peripheral Arteriopathy</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: The AHT treatment in patients with peripheral arteriopathy should follow the general recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: The cardioselective beta blockers can be used in stable peripheral arteriopathy in the mild or moderate phase whenever there is a firm indication for use.</p>
<p><em>Left Ventricular Hypertrophy</em></p>
<p><strong>D (2007)</strong>: The treatment of AHT if there is left ventricular hypertrophy must follow the general recommendations.</p>
<p><em>Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: The general recommendations for antihypertensive treatment should be followed in patients with asthma or COPD.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: In patients with asthma or COPD in mild or moderate phases, the cardioselective beta blockers can be used with precaution, whenever there is a firm indication for their use (ischaemic cardiopathy or congestive cardiac insufficiency).</p>
<p><strong>GPP</strong>: In case of severe COPD and asthma associated with ischaemic cardiopathy, the use of beta blockers must be individualized, evaluating the benefits and risks of the measure.</p>
<p><strong>Combined Drug Therapy</strong></p>
<p><strong>A (2007)</strong>: When single-drug therapy is insufficient, it is better to combine antihypertensives at half dosages in the case of diuretics, beta blockers or calcium antagonists or with usual dosages of ACEI or ARA II, than to double the single-drug dosage.</p>
<p><strong>D (2007)</strong>: The choice of the combination of antihypertensive drugs among the associations on which studies have been conducted will be according to professional criteria, taking into account their pharmacological characteristics and their profile of adverse effects.</p>
<p><strong>A (2007)</strong>: The use of the ACEI+ARA II combination is not recommended for increasing the degree of decrease of the BP.</p>
<p><strong>Hypertensive Urgency</strong></p>
<p><strong>C (2007)</strong>: In view of a high AHT number in an asymptomatic patient or with symptoms that do not suggest target organ affection, this value must be confirmed with various subsequent measurements, after eliminating aggravating factors.</p>
<p><strong>D (2007)</strong>: In view of high AHT in an asymptomatic patient or without suggestive signs of target organ affection, a gradual decrease in BP should be attempted, seeing the patient in the following days to adjust the treatment.</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>2008 Original Guideline</strong></p>
<p>This work has attempted to bring together the best evidence on the questions posed on the care of the hypertensive patient. The update was done according to a structured plan from the clinical practice guideline (CPG) on arterial hypertension (AHT) published by Osakidetza in 2002, following the same methodological principles as in the original version.</p>
<p>After the formation of the CPG editing team and of a &quot;committee of experts&quot; in AHT, a list of clinical questions was drawn up starting principally with the questions of the previous version with the inclusion of proposals by the editing team after group discussions and the proposals of the committee of experts through a previously designed instrument.</p>
<p>Previously, at the start of the work, some &quot;base&quot; CPGs were selected by applying the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research &amp;amp; Evaluation (AGREE) instrument to different national and international CPGs on AHT published in the 2002-2006 interval.</p>
<p>The three guidelines that obtained the highest score based on the AGREE instrument were: the Canadian CPG, the one from the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE), and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) guidelines. These three CPGs were used in the successive steps.</p>
<p>For the new questions, not included in the 2002 CPG, these CPGs were initially consulted. The following possibilities could occur:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Question answered and updated in the base guidelines </li>
    <li>Question with the need to be updated </li>
    <li>Question not answered </li>
</ul>
<p>For the questions included in the previous version, the bibliography provided by the committee of experts and that included in the selected CPGs were used and the systematic search of the literature limited to the 2002-2007 period was updated. A bibliographic alert service was maintained to incorporate relevant studies up to the time of publishing the CPG.</p>
<p>For all the searches, the information sources used were: Clinical Evidence, Evidence-Based Reviews, Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, &amp;Iacute;ndice Bibliogr&amp;aacute;fico Espa&amp;ntilde;ol en Ciencias de la Salud (&amp;Iacute;BECS), UpToDate and Trip database. The publications were prioritized according to the following order: systematic reviews, clinical trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, descriptive studies and experts' opinion.</p>
<p><strong>2013 Reaffirmation</strong></p>
<p>Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Evidence Updates, UpToDate, Dunamed, Clinical Evidence and the TRIP Database were searched for literature published from 2008 to June 2013.</p>
<p>The developer performed a literature search of primary and secondary sources, clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), clinical trials and systematic reviews. The developer also screened references included in systematic reviews and references of relevant articles were hand-searched for additional studies.</p></div>"/>

<p><strong>Ib Level 1</strong> studies</p>
<p><strong>II Level 2</strong> studies; systematic review of <strong>Level 2</strong> studies</p>
<p><strong>III Level 3</strong> studies; systematic review of <strong>Level 3</strong> studies</p>
<p><strong>IV</strong> Consensus, experts' opinions without explicit critical evaluation</p>
<p><strong>Level 1 Studies</strong></p>
<p>They achieve:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Masked comparison with valid reference evidence (&quot;gold standard&quot;) </li>
    <li>Adequate patient spectrum </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Level 2 Studies</strong></p>
<p>They present only one of the following biases:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Non-representative population (the sample does not reflect the population where the sample will be applied) </li>
    <li>Inadequate comparison with the reference standard (&quot;gold standard&quot;) (the sample being evaluated is part of the gold standard or the result of the evidence being evaluated has influence on the performance of the gold standard) </li>
    <li>Non-masked comparison </li>
    <li>Case control studies </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Level 3 Studies</strong></p>
<p>They present two or more of the highlighted criteria in level 2 studies</p></div>"/>

<p>With regard to the previous recommendations, the update has supposed:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Recommendation not modified: it coincides with the one recommended in the previous CPG. </li>
    <li>Recommendation completed: the recommendation goes along the same line as the previous version but the new evidence completes or expands the previous recommendation. </li>
    <li>Modified Recommendation: the new evidence means a relevant change in the recommendation. </li>

<p><strong>2013 Reaffirmation</strong></p>
<p>In May 2012, an expert committee was convened to review the currency of the guideline using the following process:</p>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Grades of Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) Grades of Recommendation</em></p>
<p><strong>A</strong> - At least one meta-analysis, systematic review or clinical study classified as 1++ and directly applicable to the guidelines' target population; or a volume of evidence comprised by studies classified as 1+ and with great consistency between them.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - A volume of evidence comprised by studies classified as 2++, directly applicable to the guidelines' target population and that shows great consistency among them; or evidence extrapolated from studies classified as 1++ or 1+.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - A volume of evidence comprised by studies classified as 2+ directly applicable to the guidelines' target population which demonstrates great consistency among them; or evidence extrapolated from studies classified as 2++.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Evidence of level 3 or 4; or evidence extrapolated from studies classified as 2+.</p>
<p><strong>GPP (Good Clinical Practice)</strong> - Recommended practice based on clinical experience and the consensus of the editing team.*</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*Upon occasion, the developing team notices important practical aspects that are necessary to highlight and for which there is probably no evidence. In general, they are related to an aspect of the treatment considered as good clinical practice that no one would normally question; they are aspects valued as points of good clinical practice. These messages are not an alternative to the recommendations based on the evidence, but must be considered only when there is no other way of highlighting said aspect.</p>
