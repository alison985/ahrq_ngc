	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions of the levels of the recommendations (<strong>A, B, C, U</strong>) and classification of the evidence (<strong>Class I-IV</strong>) are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>What is the role of diagnostic testing of children with microcephaly?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Neuroimaging</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<p>Data from 6 Class III studies (2 computed tomography [CT], 2 magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], 2 CT/MRI of 292 children with microcephaly found diagnostic yields ranging from 43% to 80%. In 2 studies, children with severe microcephaly (&amp;lt;-3 SD) were more likely (i.e., 75%, 80%) to have an abnormal MRI than those with milder microcephaly. MRI detected brain abnormalities typically beyond the sensitivity of computed tomography (CT).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>Neuroimaging may be considered useful in identifying structural causes in the evaluation of the child with microcephaly (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Genetic Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<p>Genetic etiologies may be found in 15.5% (Class II, n = 58) to 53.3% (Class III, n = 30) of children with microcephaly. MRI studies may detect specific malformations associated with well described genetic conditions.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>Specific targeted genetic testing may be considered in the evaluation of the child with microcephaly in order to determine a specific etiology (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Metabolic Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<p>The prevalence of metabolic disorders among children with microcephaly is unknown. Based on prior analysis of studies of children with global developmental delay (GDD), it is likely 1% to 5%.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to support or refute obtaining metabolic testing on a routine basis for the evaluation of the newborn or infant with microcephaly (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>What neurologic disorders are associated with microcephaly?</span> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<p>Children with microcephaly are more likely to have epilepsy, particularly epilepsy that is difficult to treat. Certain microcephaly syndromes are associated with a much higher prevalence of epilepsy. There are no systematic studies regarding electroencephalogram (EEG) testing of children with microcephaly with and without epilepsy.</p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot;>
    <li>Because children with microcephaly are at risk for epilepsy, physicians may consider educating caregivers of children with microcephaly on how to recognize clinical seizures (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>There are insufficient data to support or refute obtaining a routine EEG in a child with microcephaly (<strong>Level U</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cerebral Palsy (CP)</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<p>CP is a common disability in children with microcephaly. Microcephaly, particularly of postnatal onset and identifiable etiology, is more common in children with CP.</p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot;>
    <li>Because children with microcephaly are at risk for CP, physicians and other care providers may consider monitoring them for early signs so that supportive treatments can be initiated (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Because children with CP are at risk for developing acquired microcephaly, serial HC measurements should be followed (<strong>Level A</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Mental Retardation</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<p>Microcephaly is commonly found in developmentally and cognitively impaired children. Children with microcephaly are at a higher risk for mental retardation and there is a correlation between the degree of microcephaly and the severity of cognitive impairment.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>Because children with microcephaly are at risk for developmental disability, physicians should periodically assess development and academic achievement to determine whether further testing and rehabilitative efforts are warranted (<strong>Level A</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Ophthalmologic and Audiologic Disorders</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<p>Ophthalmologic disorders are more common in children with microcephaly but the frequency, nature, and severity of this involvement has not been studied. Data on the prevalence of audiologic disorders in children with microcephaly have not been reported. </p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<p>Screening for ophthalmologic abnormalities in children with microcephaly may be considered (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Definitions</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective, or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.*)</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective, or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective, or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an &quot;A&quot; recommendation if: 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &amp;gt;5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &amp;gt;2).</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Evidence for the Rating of a Screening Article</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: A statistical, population-based sample of patients studied at a uniform point in time (usually early) during the course of the condition. All patients undergo the intervention of interest. The outcome, if not objective, is determined in an evaluation that is masked to the patients' clinical presentations.</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: A statistical, non-referral-clinic-based sample of patients studied at a uniform point in time (usually early) during the course of the condition. Most patients undergo the intervention of interest. The outcome, if not objective, is determined in an evaluation that is masked to the patients' clinical presentations.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: A sample of patients studied during the course of the condition. Some patients undergo the intervention of interest. The outcome, if not objective, is determined in an evaluation by someone other than the treating physician.</p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong>: Studies not meeting Class I, II or III criteria including consensus, expert opinion or a case report.</p></div>"/>

<p>Literature searches were conducted with the assistance of the University of Minnesota Health Science Center for relevant articles published from 1980 to March 2007. Medline, CINAHL, and Healthstar databases were searched for relevant articles published from 1966 to 2007, using the following key words: microcephaly, magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, computed axial tomography, CT scan, metabolic disease, electroencephalography (EEG), seizures, epilepsy, vision loss, hearing loss, developmental delay, and speech and language delay. The search resulted in 4,257 titles and abstracts, which were reviewed for content regarding the diagnostic evaluation of children with microcephaly. Articles were excluded if they were Class IV studies, case series with less than 10 subjects, descriptions of research in animals, or descriptions of a single cause of syndromic microcephaly. The authors selected 150 articles for review. The ages of infants and children included in these studies were similar to the ages of children typically seen for diagnostic evaluation so it was felt that the evidence-based recommendations included in this parameter were appropriate.</p>

<p>The guideline developer searched OVID MEDLINE, CINAHLScience, and Healthstar for studies published between 2010 and 2013 using the following search terms: microcephaly, magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, computed axial tomography, CT scan, metabolic disease, electroencephalography (EEG), seizures, epilepsy, vision loss, hearing loss, developmental delay, and speech and language delay.</p></div>"/>

<p>The AAN assesses their clinical practice guidelines every 2 years to determine whether new literature has been published that would warrant an update. The following steps are taken:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Biennial correspondence is sent to all authors and the facilitator. </li>
    <li>An updated literature search and a review of methodological soundness are performed by a Guideline Development Subcommittee (GDS) member. (Note: The search should specifically seek to identify new evidence that would change the conclusions in the systematic review or recommendations in the CPG.) </li>
</ul>
<p>All documents biennially reviewed by the GDS that don't require an update are reaffirmed. See the AAN <a href=&quot;http://tools.aan.com/globals/axon/assets/9023.pdf&quot; title=&quot;AAN Web site&quot;>Clinical Practice Guideline Process Manual</a> for additional information.</p></div>"/>

<p><strong>Conflict of Interest Statement</strong></p>
<p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is committed to producing independent, critical, and truthful clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Significant efforts are made to minimize the potential for conflicts of interests to influence the recommendation of this CPG. To the extent possible, the AAN keeps separate those who have a financial stake in the success or failure of the products appraised in the CPGs and the developers of the guidelines. Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee prior to project initiation. AAN limits the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest. The AAN forbids commercial participation in, or funding of, guideline projects. Drafts of the guidelines have been reviewed by at least three AAN committees, a network of neurologists, Neurology&amp;reg; peer reviewers, and representatives from related fields. The AAN Guideline Author Conflict of Interest Policy can be viewed at <a href=&quot;http://www.aan.com&quot; title=&quot;AAN Web site&quot;>www.aan.com</a>.</p></div>"/>
