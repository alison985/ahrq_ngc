	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>Definitions of the levels of the recommendations (<strong>A, B, C, U</strong>) and classification of the evidence (<strong>Class I-IV</strong>) are provided at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Cannabinoids</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Cannabinoid Practice Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians might offer oral cannabis extract (OCE) to patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) to reduce patient-reported symptoms of spasticity and pain (excluding central neuropathic pain) (<strong>Level A</strong>) and might counsel patients that this symptomatic benefit is possibly maintained for 1 year (<strong>Level C</strong>), although OCE is probably ineffective for improving objective spasticity measures (short-term) or tremor (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p>Clinicians might offer tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to patients with MS to reduce patient-reported symptoms of spasticity and pain (excluding central neuropathic pain) (<strong>Level B</strong>). Clinicians might counsel patients that this symptomatic benefit is possibly maintained for 1 year (<strong>Level C</strong>), although THC is probably ineffective for improving objective spasticity measures (short-term) or tremor (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p>Clinicians might offer Sativex oromucosal cannabinoid spray (nabiximols), where available, to reduce symptoms of spasticity, pain, or urinary frequency, although it is probably ineffective for improving objective spasticity measures or number of urinary incontinence episodes (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p>Clinicians might choose not to offer Sativex oromucosal cannabinoid spray to reduce MS-related tremor (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p>Data are inadequate to support or refute use of the following in MS (<strong>Level U</strong>):</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>OCE/THC for bladder urge incontinence and overall symptoms </li>
    <li>Synthetic THC (Marinol) for central neuropathic pain </li>
    <li>Sativex oromucosal cannabinoid spray for overall bladder symptoms, anxiety symptoms/sleep problems, cognitive symptoms, quality of life (QOL), and fatigue </li>
    <li>Smoked cannabis for spasticity, pain, balance/posture, and cognition </li>
</ol>
<p>Data are inadequate to determine the abuse potential or effect on psychopathologic symptoms of Sativex cannabinoid spray (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Context</strong></p>
<p>The cannabinoid studies have limitations that physicians and patients must be aware of. Most studies were of short duration (6 to 15 weeks). Another limitation was the potential for central side effects to unmask patients to treatment assignment &amp;mdash; a concern with regard to all masked trials involving treatments with prominent side effects. It is also important to recognize that the Ashworth scale used for objective measurement may be insensitive to spasticity changes. These factors may contribute to the discordant effects of cannabinoids on subjective and objective spasticity measures.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Ginkgo Biloba (GB)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>GB Practice Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians might counsel patients with MS that GB is established as ineffective for improving cognitive function (<strong>Level A</strong>).</p>
<p>Clinicians might counsel patients with MS that GB is possibly effective for reducing fatigue (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Context</strong></p>
<p>GB and other supplements are not U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated. Their quality control may play a role in their effectiveness and adverse effect (AE) risk. Moreover, interactions of supplements with other medications, especially disease-modifying therapies for MS, are a clinical concern.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Low-Fat Diet with Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation (Omega-3)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Omega-3 Practice Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians might counsel patients that a low-fat diet with fish oil supplementation is probably ineffective for reducing relapses, disability, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions, or for improving fatigue or QOL in MS (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Lofepramine</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Lofepramine Practice Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians might counsel patients with MS that lofepramine plus L-phenylalanine with vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (Cari Loder regimen) is possibly ineffective for treating disability, symptoms, depression, or fatigue (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Reflexology</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Reflexology Practice Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians might counsel patients with MS that reflexology is possibly effective for reducing paresthesia (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Bee Venom</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Bee Venom Practice Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians might counsel patients with MS that bee sting therapy is possibly ineffective for reducing relapses, disability, fatigue, total MRI lesion burden, new gadolinium-enhancing lesion volume, or health-related quality of life (HRQOL) (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Context</strong></p>
<p>Bee stings can be associated with anaphylactic reaction and possible death.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Magnetic Therapy</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Magnetic Therapy Practice Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians might counsel patients with MS that magnetic therapy is probably effective for reducing fatigue (<strong>Level B</strong>) and probably ineffective for reducing depression (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Other CAM Therapies Practice Recommendation</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should counsel patients with MS that the safety and efficacy of other reviewed CAM, or the interaction of CAM with disease-modifying therapies for MS, are unknown (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Evidence for Therapeutic Interventions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: A randomized, controlled clinical trial of the intervention of interest with masked or objective outcome assessment, in a representative population. Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences.</p>
<p>The following are also required:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
    <li>Concealed allocation </li>
    <li>Primary outcome(s) clearly defined </li>
    <li>Exclusion/inclusion criteria clearly defined </li>
    <li>Adequate accounting for drop-outs (with at least 80% of enrolled subjects completing the study) and cross-overs with numbers sufficiently low to have minimal potential for bias. </li>
    <li>For noninferiority or equivalence trials claiming to prove efficacy for one or both drugs, the following are also required*:
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot;>
        <li>The authors explicitly state the clinically meaningful difference to be excluded by defining the threshold for equivalence or noninferiority. </li>
        <li>The standard treatment used in the study is substantially similar to that used in previous studies establishing efficacy of the standard treatment (e.g., for a drug, the mode of administration, dose and dosage adjustments are similar to those previously shown to be effective). </li>
        <li>The inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient selection and the outcomes of patients on the standard treatment are comparable to those of previous studies establishing efficacy of the standard treatment. </li>
        <li>The interpretation of the results of the study is based upon a per protocol analysis that takes into account dropouts or crossovers. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: A randomized controlled clinical trial of the intervention of interest in a representative population with masked or objective outcome assessment that lacks one criteria a-e above or a prospective matched cohort study with masked or objective outcome assessment in a representative population that meets b-e above. Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: All other controlled trials (including well-defined natural history controls or patients serving as own controls) in a representative population, where outcome is independently assessed, or independently derived by objective outcome measurement.**</p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong>: Studies not meeting Class I, II or III criteria including consensus or expert opinion.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>*Note that numbers 1-3 in Class Ie are required for Class II in equivalence trials. If any one of the three is missing, the class is automatically downgraded to Class III.</p>
<p class=&quot;Note&quot;>**Objective outcome measurement: an outcome measure that is unlikely to be affected by an observer's (patient, treating physician, investigator) expectation or bias (e.g., blood tests, administrative outcome data).</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective, or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.)*</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective, or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or at least two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective, or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>

    <li>Cannabinoids were generally well tolerated, although some serious adverse effects (SAEs) were reported. Few studies reported deaths in the cannabinoid-treated groups (1 due to pneumonia, 1 to seizure-related aspiration pneumonia, and 2 to cancer, presumed unrelated). Mild/moderate adverse effects (AEs) were common (approximately 50% to 80% of subjects) and appeared to be equally prevalent in subjects receiving cannabinoids or placebo. No significant laboratory, hematologic, urologic, or cardiac changes, or differences in vital signs, were noted. Central nervous system (CNS) AEs (e.g., dizziness, somnolence, drowsiness, lightheadedness, memory disturbance, difficulty concentrating) were more common in subjects receiving cannabinoids vs placebo. Dizziness was most common (15% to 50% of subjects). Gastrointestinal AEs, including increased appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and dry/sore mouth, occurred in about 10% of subjects receiving cannabinoids and were more common in those receiving cannabinoids than placebo. Other less common AEs included myalgia, increased spasticity, seizures (4/137 subjects had seizures), lower limb weakness, hemorrhagic cystitis, dehydration, temporary psychosis (1 rated as severe), hallucinations, and oral ulceration. </li>
    <li>Because cannabinoids have known psychoactive properties, their potential for psychopathologic and neurocognitive AEs is a concern, especially in a patient population that may be vulnerable due to underlying disorders. Depression and predisposal to psychosis have been reported with long-term cannabis exposure. Development of marijuana addiction is controversial; however, long-term heavy marijuana use has been associated with tolerance and dependence. Evidence is also available, albeit inconsistent, for impairments in memory, concentration, and executive functions in chronic cannabis users, although it remains unclear how long these deficits persist after abstinence and whether there is permanent neurotoxicity. In 1 study, patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and prolonged use of &quot;street&quot; cannabis had cognitive function impairments relative to patients with MS who did not use cannabis. Patients with MS who smoked cannabis regularly had more extensive cognitive abnormalities and were more likely to meet criteria for a lifetime Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) psychiatric diagnosis. Although not generalizable to medical cannabis, the associations from these studies of street cannabis raise concerns. A substudy of the large Class I study reviewed, available only in abstract form, reported a significant reduction in verbal learning and memory in patients with MS receiving cannabis extracts vs those receiving placebo. Several of the reviewed studies assessed psychopathology and cognition as secondary outcomes without significant AEs; however, these studies were short-term and inadequately powered to exclude an effect. </li>
    <li>Clinicians should counsel patients about the potential for psychopathologic/cognitive and other AEs associated with cannabinoids. Sativex oromucosal cannabinoid spray is not U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved and is unavailable in the United States. In the United States, caution should be exercised with regard to extrapolation of results of trials of standardized oral cannabis extracts (OCEs) (which are unavailable commercially) to other nonstandardized, nonregulated cannabis extracts (which may be commercially available in states with medical marijuana laws) </li>
    <li>Ginkgo biloba (GB) and other supplements are not FDA regulated. Their quality control may play a role in their effectiveness and AE risk. Moreover, interactions of supplements with other medications, especially disease-modifying therapies for MS, are a clinical concern. </li>
    <li>One study on magnetic therapy reported headache, spasms, and burning sensation. </li>

    <li>The review on which the original guideline is based has several limitations. Because the search strategy is limited only to multiple sclerosis (MS), some potentially important adverse effects (AEs) (e.g., bleeding risk with gingko biloba [GB]) of the reviewed therapies noted when they were evaluated in other diseases were not apparent in the MS population. Therapies that have received much press attention (e.g., dental amalgam removal, transdermal histamine) have little evidence to support recommendations. </li>
