<p>The research and development process is primarily conducted by the lead physician author with staff support, including medical librarians, and is overseen by the AIM members of the Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC). The resources considered during AIM Guidelines development can include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>

<p>Additional web-based searches for evidence-based clinical guidelines and appropriate use criteria may also be performed using the National Guideline Clearinghouse website. Searches of the primary literature for an AIM Guideline under review are also conducted using standard databases and clinical knowledge resources. Relevant evidence-based literature or information may be brought to AIM's attention at any time by providers, AIM's physician reviewers, committee members, or other interested parties. This additional information may warrant off-cycle review and modification to include clinically-important recommendations, in addition to the usual process as determined by the Chair of the CGC.</p>
<p>A database is used to track the various sources of information referenced. A digital copy of each source document, including primary literature, is stored.

<p><strong>Review Process</strong></p>
<p>When a new Guideline(s) is considered, the Chair of the Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) may choose to form a Specialty Panel to assist with the drafting and review of the Guideline. Similarly, the assigned AIM Medical Director may use a Specialty Panel to review and comment on proposed revisions to existing Guidelines.</p>
<p>In order for a new or revised Guideline to be approved for use by AIM, it must be reviewed by the Internal Panel of AIM physician reviewers. The Internal Panel considers supporting evidence as well as usability and validity within the education and adjudication process. The Internal Panel votes to forward recommendations to the Independent Physician Panel.</p>
<p>The Independent Physician Panel considers supporting evidence and the potential impact of draft AIM Guidelines on clinical outcomes and practice. The external panel votes to forward recommendations onto the CGC.</p>
<p>An AIM Medical Director is assigned to each program or solution for purposes of the guideline development and review process. These AIM Medical Directors are responsible for drafting new Guidelines as necessary and ensuring that every Guideline and the procedures for applying it, is reviewed and assessed for continued validity at least once annually. The assigned AIM Medical Directors are responsible for monitoring the clinical and regulatory environment with the support of AIM medical librarians to determine when Guideline revisions are necessary, based on new, potentially-relevant evidence and other factors. The assigned AIM Medical Directors are responsible for supporting the Vice President, Clinical Operations in facilitating education and training for the staff regarding the Guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Committee and Panel Operational Process</strong></p>
<p>Review requires that the Guideline and any supporting materials be provided to members who are given sufficient time for review. The body then meets (either in person or telephonically) to discuss the proposed changes or enhancements. Approval of a Guideline is demonstrated by a vote of at least a majority of the members of that body who are present at the meeting (but in no event fewer than three [3] affirmative votes). If approval is received, then the Guideline can proceed to the next stage of the process. If committee approval is not received at any stage of the process, then the assigned AIM Medical Director shall be responsible for addressing committee member concerns and resubmitting the Guideline for committee review.</p>
<p>Minutes of all meetings are maintained as well as documentation of all proposed, approved and tabled Guidelines and changes to Guidelines. All input received during any level of review is recorded and noted in any subsequent review. Input received after approval of a Guideline is presented at the next regularly scheduled CGC meeting.</p>
<p>The AIM Quality Improvement Committee (QIC) reviews and accepts the Guidelines.</p>
<p>Ultimate responsibility and accountability for the development, review and updating of AIM's Guidelines are delegated to the CGC. No new or revised Guideline can be implemented without CGC approval.</p></div>"/>
