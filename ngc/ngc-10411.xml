	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Practical Application Points</span></strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Outcomes assessment scales provide a concise, valid way to track function and improvement in function. Meaningful change usually involves at least a 30% improvement in score. 50% improvement can typically be considered to be substantial. </li>
    <li>Anchored numerical scales are recommended for tracking routine progress, particularly pain interference with important activities. </li>
    <li>Regional or condition functional outcome scales should be routinely used at baseline and periodic follow-ups. More frequent follow-up is recommended with higher frequency care. </li>
    <li>Psychosocial scales help identify those at higher risk of chronicity and improvement in fear avoidance scales predicts later improvement. </li>
    <li>Several physical performance outcomes also have substantial reported reliability and clinical meaningfulness. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Functional Improvement</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Ideally, care should contribute to better and faster improvement in function and return-to-work than natural progression. To determine degree of improvement, it is recommended that specific function and activity levels be documented before care begins and at periodic intervals as care is provided. Examples of valid and reliable patient self-report strategies and tools are included in this resource. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Curative &amp;amp; Rehabilitative Care</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Washington State workers' compensation law mandates that the care workers receive is curative and/or rehabilitative (WAC 296-20-01002). In non-catastrophic cases, this has been operationalized by clinical documentation that demonstrates improved physical function (including return-to-work) is occurring. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Maximal Medical Improvement (MMI)</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>MMI occurs when no marked change in the workers' condition can be expected, with or without treatment. Fluctuations in pain and function may occur once MMI is reached. Over time, improvement or deterioration may occur once MMI is reached. Treatment that results only in temporary or transient changes is not considered proper and necessary (WAC 296-20-01002). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General Health/Biopsychosocial Status Measurement Summary</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Numerous instruments have been used to capture general health status. Instruments typically capture elements of physical and mental function attributable to the respondent's state of health. The most widely used validated examples include the Short Form (SF)-36, Health Status Questionnaire (HSQ)-36, SF-12, and HSQ-12. </li>
    <li>Increasing evidence has emerged that fear of activity and low recovery expectations are associated with poorer outcomes from common musculoskeletal conditions. Increasing attention to assessing and tracking certain mental health and psychosocial health status elements has resulted in using instruments (e.g., STarT Back Screening Tool [SBST]-9, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia [TSK-11], Fear-Avoidance Belief Questionnaire [FABQ]) to help determine which interventions should be considered and to assess improvement. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Regional Functional Measurement Summary</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Many anatomic regional area instruments have been developed for the neck, back, and upper and lower limbs. These have the advantage of assessing impact of multiple affected sites with a single instrument. Examples include the Quick Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH), Neck Disability Index (NDI), Modified Oswestry Low Back Disability Index (ODI), and Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS). </li>
    <li>Instruments addressing a specific joint (e.g., Simple Shoulder Test [SST] for shoulder, Foot and Ankle Ability Measure [FAAM] for foot and ankle) have also been validated and sometimes offer more specificity and sensitivity to monitor response to interventions. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Condition-Specific Measurement Summary</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Instruments have also been developed and validated for a specific condition such as carpal tunnel syndrome, lateral epicondylitis, osteoarthritis, and many other conditions seen in occupational and primary care. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Physical Performance Testing (PPT) Measurement Summary</strong></p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>PPT may help assess/track conditioning particularly when recovery is not evident by 4 to 6 weeks. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Assessing Study Methodologic Quality</strong></p>
<p>Attributes of study methodology quality vary according to the clinical procedure (e.g., diagnostic, therapeutic intervention) looked at, and specific research questions being studied. The American Academy of Neurology's Clinical Practice Guideline Process Manual offers a comprehensive guide to systematic evidence review, quality attributes and consensus process that generally serves as the approach taken by Industrial Insurance Chiropractic Advisory Committee (IICAC).</p>
<p>General attributes identified when extracting evidence from studies include identification of population, the intervention and co-interventions and outcomes being addressed in each study. The clinical questions addressed such as diagnostic accuracy, therapeutic effectiveness, or causation are determined. Studies are extracted into evidence tables including quality attributes and/or ratings which are reviewed both by department staff and committee members (usually 2 per study).</p>
<p>Specific quality attributes include: Diagnostic Accuracy &amp;ndash; design, spectrum of patients, validity and relevance of outcome metric; Therapeutic Interventions &amp;ndash; comparison groups (no treatment, placebo, comparative intervention), treatment allocation, blinding/masking (method and degree: single, double, independent), follow-up (period and completion), and analysis (statistical power, intent-to-treat). Specific attention is paid to several factors including reporting of outcomes (primary vs. secondary), relevance of outcome (e.g., function versus pain), and meaningfulness (clinically important change versus minimally detectable change).</p>
<p><strong>Synthesizing Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Consideration of study quality (class), significance (statistical precision), consistency across studies, magnitude of effect, and relevance to populations and procedures were taken into account in preparing draft summaries. Special attention was given to clarifying conclusions related to the clinical questions of interest. Evidence, particularly with low tech and highly diffused examination and conservative procedures addressed here, is rarely truly &quot;definitive,&quot; even when multiple studies exist. Inconsistent conclusions typically reflect error (systematic, random) and/or bias in studies. Data pooling via meta-analysis is useful to reduce random error when studies are of sufficient power and methodologic strength. Larger meaningful effect size may increases confidence in findings.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The conservative care resource/guideline process can be described in the following steps:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Once a topic for a resource/guideline is selected, a subcommittee of the Industrial Insurance Chiropractic Advisory Committee (IICAC) made up of regular members identifies additional content experts to join the subcommittee and/or serve as consultants. Various clinical specialists may provide specific input or be invited to give a presentation to the subcommittee. </li>
    <li>A systematic review and summary of the relevant peer-reviewed clinical and scientific literature is done (primarily by department staff and subcommittee members with specific interest and/or expertise in a topic). Claim and billing data from Labor &amp;amp; Industries may also be reviewed. </li>
    <li>Literature is retrieved, assessed for quality and summarized in evidence tables which are presented to the subcommittee for review. Then at a variable series of group meetings and phone conferences, the evidence with greatest relevance to the resource/guideline topic is highlighted. </li>
    <li>Based on this literature review and assessment by the subcommittee, department staff typically develop an initial draft resource guideline generally organized as follows:
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>General summary of topic, case definition, clinical evaluation, interventions, and clinical progress </li>
        <li>Checklist for general chronological management with expected clinical and progress thresholds </li>
        <li>Readily usable functional progress instruments for a given condition </li>
        <li>Evidence summaries for clinical assessment (e.g., history, examination, imaging and special studies, prognostic and management issues, workers' compensation issues) </li>
        <li>Evidence summaries for conservative interventions (e.g., physiotherapeutic modalities, bracing, manipulation and mobilization, soft tissue techniques, exercise and rehabilitation approaches, special interventions, common medications [injected and oral]), and workers compensation specific interventions (e.g., ergonomic interventions) </li>
        <li>Additional materials (glossaries, procedure descriptions, instrument scoring) </li>
        <li>Evidence and methodology process used in development </li>
        <li>Citations </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Subcommittee members critique and revise the guideline based on what is most useful for the clinician in diagnosing and treating the condition in question. Additional expertise, consultation, and literature searches may also be added. This results in a second draft guideline that is then shared with the full advisory committee to obtain their input. At this stage specific content experts/reviewers may be sought as the subcommittee identifies particular issues. </li>
