      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>The following recommendations have been adapted from existing practice guidelines and consensus statements, including those from the Alberta Health Services (AHS) Province-wide Immunization Program.</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Immunization against <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> using pneumococcal vaccine(s) is very important for patients who may be immunosuppressed as a result of their malignancy or treatment of their malignancy. This includes patients with solid tumours, leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, Hodgkin disease, those receiving hematopoietic stem cell (HSCT) or blood and marrow transplants (BMT), and those receiving chemotherapy. </li>
    <li>Adult and pediatric patients who as a result of their malignancy or treatment of their malignancy may be immunosuppressed should consult with Public/Community Health regarding an immunization schedule for receipt of pneumococcal vaccines. </li>
    <li>Adult and pediatric patients undergoing BMT should consult with Public/Community Health regarding an immunization schedule for receipt of pneumococcal vaccine(s) starting at six months post-transplant. When the recipient is at high risk of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), vaccine response may be improved by donor vaccination. </li>
    <li>Vaccine types:
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
        <li>Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13): evidence from healthy children under 2 years who have been vaccinated indicates that serotype-specific efficacy is between 94% and 97%. </li>
        <li>Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PNEUMO-P, Pneumovax&amp;reg; 23): the overall effectiveness of PNEUMO-P at preventing pneumococcal bacteremia is between 50% and 70% in healthy individuals. Of note, it is less effective than the conjugate vaccine in protecting immunosuppressed patients. In particular, it has been substantially less effective in patients with multiple myeloma, Hodgkin disease, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, especially during active treatment. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Timing:
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
        <li>Pneumococcal immunization should be given four to six weeks (and at least 14 days) before the start of chemotherapy. </li>
        <li>Immunization during chemotherapy or radiation therapy should be avoided because antibody responses are suboptimal. If this is not possible, and delay of treatment would result in an increased risk of cancer-related complications or death, it is recommended that, for those patients who would likely benefit from the vaccine, immunization be delayed for three months after completing immunosuppressive chemotherapy. </li>
        <li>Patients immunized while on immunosuppressive therapy or within the two weeks before starting therapy should be considered unimmunized and should be reimmunized at least three months after discontinuation of therapy. Further discussion with Alberta Health Services - Public Health may be appropriate before the patient is reimmunized. </li>
        <li>Pneumococcal polysaccharide immunization, unlike influenza vaccination, is given as a once-only vaccine; however, re-immunization is recommended in certain populations once in three to five years depending on when the patient was initially immunized with PNEUMO-P. Refer patient to Public/Community Health for further assessment. </li>
        <li>When PCV-13 is also indicated, the conjugate vaccine series/dose should be completed prior to administering PNEUMO-P. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Pneumococcal vaccine is contraindicated in the following people:
    <ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;>
        <li>Anyone who has had an anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine. </li>
        <li>Anyone who has an anaphylactic reaction or other allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine. </li>
        <li>Defer immunization in anyone who presents with a serious acute febrile illness; recommendations should be provided for these individuals to be immunized when their symptoms have resolved. Individuals with non-serious febrile illness may be immunized. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Although there is no evidence that PNEUMO-P is harmful to either a pregnant woman or to her fetus, it is not recommended during pregnancy. Pregnant women who have chronic illnesses should consult their provider before being immunized. Women who have underlying conditions known to put them at risk of pneumococcal disease should be immunized before pregnancy, if possible.</p>

<p>The PubMed (1965 through August 2012) database was searched for practice guidelines, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and clinical trials. The National Guideline Clearinghouse was also searched for relevant guidelines, in addition to individual guideline developers' websites: World Health Organization, Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the D&amp;eacute;partement D'Oncologie P&amp;eacute;diatrique (France).

<p><strong>Evidence Tables</strong></p>
<p>Evidence tables containing the first author, year of publication, patient group/stage of disease, methodology, and main outcomes of interest are assembled using the studies identified in the literature search.

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Formulating Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The working group members formulated the guideline recommendations based on the evidence synthesized by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist during the planning process, blended with expert clinical interpretation of the evidence. As detailed in the <a href=&quot;http://www.albertahealthservices.ca/hp/if-hp-cancer-guide-utilization-handbook.pdf&quot; title=&quot;Alberta Health Services Web site&quot;>Guideline Utilization Resource Unit Handbook</a> (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field), the working group members may decide to adopt the recommendations of another institution without any revisions, adapt the recommendations of another institution or institutions to better reflect local practices, or develop their own set of recommendations by adapting some, but not all, recommendations from different guidelines.</p>
<p>The degree to which a recommendation is based on expert opinion of the working group and/or the Provincial Tumour Team members is explicitly stated in the guideline recommendations. Similar to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) methodology for formulating guideline recommendations, the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU) does not use formal rating schemes for describing the strength of the recommendations, but rather describes, in conventional and explicit language, the type and quality of the research and existing guidelines that were taken into consideration when formulating the recommendations.</p>
<p>The recommendations in the current guideline have been adapted from existing practice guidelines and consensus statements, including those from the Alberta Health Services (AHS) <em>Province-wide Immunization Program</em>. Evidence from clinical trials, retrospective reviews, and case studies was also reviewed and considered.</p></div>"/>

<p>When the draft guideline document has been completed, revised, and reviewed by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist and the working group members, it is sent to all members of the Provincial Tumour Team for review and comment. This step ensures that those intended to use the guideline have the opportunity to review the document and identify potential difficulties for implementation before the guideline is finalized. Depending on the size of the document, and the number of people it is sent to for review, a deadline of one to two weeks will usually be given to submit any feedback. Ideally, this review will occur prior to the annual Provincial Tumour Team meeting, and a discussion of the proposed edits will take place at the meeting. The working group members will then make final revisions to the document based on the received feedback, as appropriate. Once the guideline is finalized, it will be officially endorsed by the Provincial Tumour Team Lead and the Executive Director of Provincial Tumour Programs.</p></div>"/>
