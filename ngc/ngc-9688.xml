        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Routine monitoring of pulse and blood pressure should be done during emergence and recovery, and electrocardiographic monitors should be immediately available. </li>
        <li>Assessment of neuromuscular function should be performed during emergence and recovery for patients who have received nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents or who have medical conditions associated with neuromuscular dysfunction. </li>
        <li>Mental status should be periodically assessed during emergence and recovery. </li>
        <li>Patient temperature should be periodically assessed during emergence and recovery. </li>
        <li>Pain should be periodically assessed during emergence and recovery. </li>
        <li>Periodic assessment of nausea and vomiting should be performed routinely during emergence and recovery. </li>
        <li>Postoperative hydration status should be assessed in the postanesthesia care unit and managed accordingly.
        <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
            <li>Certain procedures involving significant loss of blood or fluids may require additional fluid management. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Assessment of urine output and of urinary voiding should be done on a case-by-case basis for selected patients or selected procedures during emergence and recovery. </li>
        <li>Assessment of drainage and bleeding should be performed. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Prophylaxis and Treatment of Nausea and Vomiting</strong>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Antiemetic agents should be used for the prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting when indicated. </li>
        <li>Multiple antiemetic agents may be used for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting when indicated. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Treatment during Emergence and Recovery</strong>
    <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
        <li>Administering supplemental oxygen during transportation or in the recovery room should be done for patients at risk of hypoxemia. </li>
        <li>Normothermia should be a goal during emergence and recovery.
        <ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
            <li>When available, forced air warming systems should be used for treating hypothermia. </li>

<p>For the literature review, potentially relevant clinical studies were identified via electronic and manual searches of the literature. The updated electronic and manual searches covered an 11-yr period from 2002 through 2012. Citations obtained during the updated search were combined with literature reviewed during development of the original Guidelines, resulting in more than 1300 citations that addressed topics related to the evidence linkages. Eighty-two new articles were accepted as evidence, and findings were compared with the original Guidelines, resulting in a total of 619 articles used as postanesthetic care evidence. For reporting purposes in this updated document, only new citations are referenced. A complete bibliography used to develop these Guidelines, organized by section, is available as Supplemental Digital Content 2, <a href=&quot;http://links.lww.com/ALN/A907&quot; title=&quot;LWW Web site&quot;>http://links.lww.com/ALN/A907</a>.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Scientific Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>Findings from the aggregated literature are reported in the text of the Guidelines by evidence category, level, and direction. Evidence categories refer specifically to the strength and quality of the <em>research design</em> of the studies. Category A evidence represents results obtained from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and Category B evidence represents observational results obtained from nonrandomized study designs or RCTs without pertinent controls. When available, Category A evidence is given precedence over Category B evidence in the reporting of results. These evidence categories are further divided into evidence levels. Evidence levels refer specifically to the strength and quality of the summarized study <em>findings</em> (i.e., statistical findings, type of data, and the number of studies reporting/replicating the findings) within the two evidence categories. For this document, only the highest level of evidence is included in the summary report for each intervention, including a directional designation of benefit, harm, or equivocality for each outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Category A</strong></p>
<p>RCTs report comparative findings between clinical interventions for specified outcomes. Statistically significant (<em>P</em> &amp;lt;0.01) outcomes are designated as either beneficial (B) or harmful (H) for the patient; statistically nonsignificant findings are designated as equivocal (E).</p>
<p><em>Level 1</em>: The literature contains a sufficient number of RCTs to conduct meta-analysis, and meta-analytic findings from these aggregated studies are reported as evidence.</p>
<p><em>Level 2</em>: The literature contains multiple RCTs, but the number of RCTs is not sufficient to conduct a viable meta-analysis for the purpose of these Guidelines. Findings from these RCTs are reported as evidence.</p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: The literature contains a single RCT, and findings from this study are reported as evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Category B</strong></p>
<p>Observational studies or RCTs without pertinent comparison groups may permit inference of beneficial or harmful relationships among clinical interventions and outcomes. Inferred findings are given a directional designation of beneficial (B), harmful (H) or equivocal (E). For studies that report statistical findings, the threshold for significance is <em>P</em> &amp;lt;0.01.</p>
<p><em>Level 1</em>: The literature contains observational comparisons (e.g., cohort, case-control research designs) between clinical interventions for a specified outcome.</p>
<p><em>Level 2</em>: The literature contains observational studies with associative statistics (e.g., relative risk, correlation, sensitivity/specificity).</p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: The literature contains noncomparative observational studies with descriptive statistics (e.g., frequencies, percentages).</p>
<p><em>Level 4</em>: The literature contains case reports.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Insufficient Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The <em>lack</em> of sufficient scientific evidence in the literature may occur when the evidence is either unavailable (i.e., no pertinent studies found) or inadequate. Inadequate literature cannot be used to assess relationships among clinical interventions and outcomes, since such literature does not permit a clear interpretation of findings due to methodological concerns (e.g., confounding in study design or implementation) or does not meet the criteria for content as defined in the &quot;Focus&quot; of the Guidelines.</p>
<p><strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>Opinion-Based Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The original Guidelines contained formal survey information collected from expert consultants and a random sample of active members of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). Additional information was obtained from open-forum presentations and other invited and public sources. All opinion-based evidence relevant to each topic (e.g., survey data, open-forum testimony, internet-based comments, letters, and editorials) was considered in the development of the original Guidelines. However, only the findings obtained from formal surveys are reported. Survey responses from the consultants and ASA members obtained during development of the original Guidelines are summarized in the text of this update and reported in appendix 2 of the original guideline document. No new surveys were conducted for this update.</p>
<p><strong>Category A: Expert Opinion</strong></p>
<p>Survey responses from Task Force&amp;ndash;appointed expert consultants are reported in summary form in the text, with a complete listing of consultant survey responses reported in appendix 2 of the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Category B: Membership Opinion</strong></p>
<p>Survey responses from a random sample of active ASA members are reported in summary form in the text, with a complete listing of ASA member survey responses reported in appendix 2 of the original guideline document.</p>
<p>Survey responses from expert and membership sources are recorded using a three-point scale and summarized based on weighted values. The following terms describe survey responses for any specified issue. Responses are assigned a numeric value of agree = +1, undecided = 0, or disagree = &amp;minus;1. The average weighted response represents the mean value for each survey item.</p>
<p class=&quot;Indent&quot;><em>Agree</em>: The average weighted response must be equal to or greater than +0.30 (on a scale of &amp;minus;1 to 1) to indicate agreement.</p>
<p class=&quot;Indent&quot;><em>Equivocal</em>: The average weighted response must be between &amp;minus;0.30 and +0.30 (on a scale of &amp;minus;1 to 1) to indicate an equivocal response.</p>
<p class=&quot;Indent&quot;><em>Disagree</em>: The average weighted response must be equal to or less than &amp;minus;0.30 (on a scale of &amp;minus;1 to 1) to indicate disagreement.</p>
<p><strong>Category C: Informal Opinion</strong></p>
<p>Open-forum testimony during development of the previous Guidelines, internet-based comments, letters, and editorials are all informally evaluated and discussed during the formulation of Guideline recommendations. When warranted, the Task Force may add educational information or cautionary notes based on this information.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>State of the Literature</strong></p>
<p>Initially, each pertinent study finding was classified and summarized to determine meta-analysis potential. The original Guidelines reported literature pertaining to seven clinical interventions that contained enough studies with well-defined experimental designs and statistical information to conduct formal meta-analyses (See Table 1 in original guideline document). These seven interventions were as follows: (1) prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting, (2) treatment of nausea and vomiting (i.e., ondansetron only), (3) multiple medications for the prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting, (4) supplemental oxygen, (5) forced-air warming systems, (6) meperidine for shivering, and (7) reversal agents to antagonize the effects of sedatives, analgesics, or neuromuscular blocking agents. Review of new literature published after completion of the original Guidelines in 2001 contained a sufficient number of studies to conduct meta-analyses addressing the prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting (see table 2 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>General variance-based effect-size estimates or combined probability tests were obtained for continuous outcome measures, and Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios were obtained for dichotomous outcome measures. Two combined probability tests were used as follows: (1) the Fisher combined test, producing chi-square values based on logarithmic transformations of the reported <em>P</em> values from the independent studies, and (2) the Stouffer combined test, providing weighted representation of the studies by weighting each of the standard normal deviates by the size of the sample. An odds-ratio procedure based on the Mantel-Haenszel method for combining study results using 2 &amp;times; 2 tables was used with outcome frequency information. An acceptable significance level was set at <em>P</em> value less than 0.01 (one-tailed). Tests for heterogeneity of the independent studies were conducted to assure consistency among the study results. DerSimonian-Laird random-effects odds ratios were obtained when significant heterogeneity was found (<em>P</em> &amp;lt;0.01). To control for potential publishing bias, a &quot;fail-safe n&quot; value was calculated. No search for unpublished studies was conducted, and no reliability tests for locating research results were done. When available, odds ratio and combined-test findings must all agree for them to be considered significant.</p>
<p>Meta-analysis of new literature reported significant odds ratios for the prevention of nausea and vomiting for the following interventions: dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron, and dexamethasone (8 mg); findings for metoclopramide and dexamethasone (4&amp;ndash;5 mg only) were equivocal. No new combined tests were conducted due to an insufficient number of studies with continuous or interval level data. In the original Guidelines, interobserver agreement among Task Force members and two methodologists was established by interrater reliability testing. Agreement levels using a kappa (&amp;kappa;) statistic for two-rater agreement pairs were as follows: type of study design, &amp;kappa; = 0.80&amp;ndash;1.00; (2) type of analysis, &amp;kappa; = 0.55&amp;ndash;1.00; (3) evidence linkage assignment, &amp;kappa; = 0.91&amp;ndash;1.00; and (4) literature inclusion for database, &amp;kappa; = 0.78&amp;ndash;1.00. Three-rater chance-corrected agreement values were as follows: (1) study design, Sav = 0.86, Var (Sav) = 0.011; (2) type of analysis, Sav = 0.65, Var (Sav) = 0.026; (3) linkage assignment, Sav = 0.81, Var (Sav) = 0.005; and (4) literature database inclusion, Sav = 0.84, Var (Sav) = 0.045. These values represent moderate to high levels of agreement. For the updated Guidelines, the same two methodologists involved in the original Guidelines conducted the literature review.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus-Based Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The original Guidelines obtained consensus from multiple sources, including: (1) survey opinion from consultants who were selected based on their knowledge or expertise in difficult airway management, (2) survey opinions solicited from active members of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), (3) testimony for the previous update from attendees of a publicly held open forum at a major national anesthesia meeting,&amp;Dagger; (4) internet commentary, and (5) task force opinion and interpretation. The rate of return was 50% (n = 56/112) for the consultants and 21% (n = 211/1,000) for the membership (see Table 3 in the original guideline document). Consultants and ASA members were supportive of all of the interventions, with the following exceptions: (1) routine assessment of urinary output and voiding, (2) routine pharmacologic prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting, (3) nonpharmacologic treatment of nausea and vomiting, (4) supplemental oxygen during transport or in the postanesthesia care unit, (5) routine use of flumazenil and naloxone, (6) requiring that patients urinate before discharge, (7) requiring that patients drink water before discharge, and (8) requiring a minimum stay in recovery. The original Guidelines also included an additional survey sent to the expert consultants asking them to indicate which, if any, of the evidence linkages would change their clinical practices if the Guideline update was instituted. The rate of return was 35% (N = 39/112). The percent of responding Consultants expecting <em>no change</em> associated with each linkage were as follows: assessment and monitoring of respiratory function&amp;mdash; 100%; cardiovascular assessment/monitoring&amp;mdash;95%; assessment of neuromuscular function&amp;mdash;95%; assessment of mental status&amp;mdash; 97%; assessment of temperature&amp;mdash;95%; assessment and monitoring of pain&amp;mdash;100%; assessment of nausea and vomiting&amp;mdash;97%; fluid assessment and management&amp;mdash; 100%; assessment and monitoring of urine output and voiding&amp;mdash;95%; assessment of draining and bleeding&amp;mdash; 100%; prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting&amp;mdash;95%; treatment of nausea and vomiting&amp;mdash;97%; multiple medications for the prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting&amp;mdash;95%; multiple medications for the treatment of nausea and vomiting&amp;mdash;97%; administration of supplemental oxygen&amp;mdash;100%; normalizing patient temperature&amp;mdash;100%; forced-air warming systems&amp;mdash; 85%; meperidine for shivering&amp;mdash;92%; flumazenil for reversal of general anesthesia&amp;mdash;95%; flumazenil for reversal of sedation&amp;mdash;97%; naloxone for opioid reversal&amp;mdash;100%; edrophonium for reversal of neuromuscular blockade&amp;mdash;97%; neostigmine for reversal of neuromuscular blockade&amp;mdash;100%; not requiring that patients urinate before discharge&amp;mdash;92%; not requiring patients to drink water without vomiting before discharge&amp;mdash;85%; requiring that patients have a responsible individual accompany them home&amp;mdash;95%; and not requiring a mandatory minimum stay in recovery&amp;mdash;85%. Eighty-two percent of the respondents indicated that the Guidelines would have <em>no effect</em> on the amount of time spent on a typical case.</p>

<p>The Task Force developed the original Guidelines by means of a seven-step process. First, they reached consensus on the criteria for evidence. Second, original published research studies from peer-reviewed journals relevant to postanesthetic care were reviewed and evaluated. Third, expert consultants were asked to: (1) participate in opinion surveys on the effectiveness of various post-anesthetic care-management recommendations and (2) review and comment on a draft of the Guidelines. Fourth, opinions about the Guideline recommendations were solicited from a sample of active members of the ASA. Fifth, opinion-based information obtained during an open forum for the original Guidelines, held at a major national meeting,&amp;Dagger; was evaluated. Sixth, the consultants were surveyed to assess their opinions on the feasibility of implementing the Guidelines. Seventh, all available information was used to build consensus to finalize the Guidelines. In 2011, the ASA Committee on Standards and Practice Parameters requested the updating of the scientific evidence for this Guideline. This update consists of an evaluation of literature published after completion of the original Guidelines.</p>
