    <li>The Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) Guidelines Expert Panel recommends that a pilot study be performed to investigate how to implement FIT in the population-based colorectal cancer (CRC) screening program in Ontario. This pilot study should evaluate FIT based on laboratory, field, and economic factors. The laboratory component would evaluate specimen stability under varying conditions and the feasibility of automation. The field component would evaluate kit distribution, labelling of kits, stool sampling, and transportation of completed kits to the laboratory. An economic evaluation would be included. </li>
    <li>Any program implemented should use automated kit labelling (e.g., bar code) and not require a separate requisition for the kit. </li>

<p>The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were systematically searched for articles assessing fecal immunochemical test (FIT) screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) published between 1996 and indexed through June 2010. The search strategies used are listed in Appendix D in the original guideline document. Additionally, the websites of a large number of agencies and organizations were also searched for evidence, and a listing of all sources searched and the number of articles ordered and retained appears in Table 2 in the original guideline document. Expert Panel members were also canvassed to ensure that no relevant articles were missed.</p>
<p>In addition to the evidence obtained in this review, the knowledge obtained from the ColonCancerCheck Program will be considered when making recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Selection Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Eligible sources of information had to meet the following criteria:</p>
<ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;>
    <li>Published full reports with information on any of performance, usability, or specimen stability factors as listed above </li>
    <li>Systematic reviews (SRs), randomized controlled trials (RCTs), other prospective study designs, retrospective study designs, and mixed design studies. For the purpose of this paper, systematic reviews including those that are the evidentiary foundation for clinical practice guidelines or health technology assessments, or similar reports were included, provided that they reported in detail (e.g., search methods, selection criteria) on a systematic search and summary of the health care literature for articles on a relevant topic. </li>
    <li>Reports published in English </li>

<p>An assessment of study quality was performed for all the included evidence. For randomized controlled trials (RCTs), no specific instrument was used, but items such as randomization, sample size estimates and power calculation, and funding sources were reported on. The Expert Panel recognizes that, due to the nature of the studies being examined, blinding to the intervention was not always possible, and therefore the lack of blinding was not considered a methodological flaw, nor was lack of a reported period of follow-up.</p>
<p>For the other evidence types, the Quality Assessment of Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy included in Systematic Reviews (QUADAS) tool was used where appropriate. The QUADAS tool is a 14-item questionnaire intended to assess primary studies of diagnostic utility for systematic reviews. The QUADAS instrument can only be used to assess studies of diagnostic utility where one test is compared with another (typically, the gold standard). For diagnostic studies without a comparator, no formal quality assessment was planned.</p></div>"/>

<p>Prior to the External Review (ER) of this Evidence-Based Series (EBS) draft report, it was submitted for Internal Review on March 9, 2011 to the Director of the PEBC, Dr. Melissa Brouwers, a researcher with expertise in methodological issues. The document was approved, pending changes, by Dr. Brouwers on March 15, 2011.</p>
<p><strong>External Review: Targeted Peer Review (TPR)</strong></p>
<p>Beginning on May 9, 2011, the PEBC Director-approved document was distributed to individuals in Canada with relevant expertise as part of the TPR process. It must be noted that the ER consisted of standardized survey questions that are used for all PEBC guidelines; therefore, some of the included questions regarding the recommendations are not fully relevant to this specific guideline. The survey was completed on June 20, 2011, and the results were analyzed. A total of seven individuals were invited to participate, and a total of seven submitted responses (100% response rate).</p>
<p><strong>Expert Panel Response: Targeted Peer Review</strong></p>
<p>Upon completion of the ER procedure, the Expert Panel reviewed the results of the TPR portion. The EBS was well received, and none of the TPR respondents rated the document as being of low quality or strongly disagreed with the findings. The majority of respondents rated the quality of the document high or highest and agreed with the findings.</p>
<p><strong>External Review: Professional Consultation (PC)</strong></p>
<p>Beginning on May 9, 2011, the PEBC Director-approved document was distributed to individuals within the Province of Ontario with relevant expertise as part of a PC review process. It must be noted that the ER questions in the survey used for all PEBC guidelines are standardized; therefore, some of the included questions regarding the recommendations are not fully relevant to this specific guideline. The survey was completed on June 20, 2011 and the results were analyzed. A total of 262 individuals were invited to participate (a total of 253 received the survey to complete), and a total of 107 submitted responses (42.3% response rate).</p>
<p><strong>Expert Panel Response: Professional Consultation</strong></p>
<p>Upon completion of the ER procedure, the Expert Panel reviewed the results of the PC portion. Generally, the EBS was well-received although some respondents did rate the quality low or lowest and disagreed or strongly disagreed with the findings. However, the majority of the respondents did report the document being of good or high quality and agreed or strongly agreed with the findings. Regarding the comments received, the Expert Panel agrees with the majority of the feedback obtained and will take these comments into consideration moving forward. The Expert Panel agrees with the barriers and enablers identified in the External Review and will take them into consideration moving forward.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The use of fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is associated with greater specimen instability for both time between stool sampling and kit processing (according to the manufacturer's inserts, only three of the examined FITs are stable for &amp;ge;7 days, and only two are stable for &amp;ge;15 days) and temperature (two studies reported an association between lower temperatures and longer stability). FIT may also be associated with higher positivity rates than is standard guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT). Three studies found higher positivity rates associated with FIT, two of which were statistically significantly higher, while only one of the studies found significantly higher positivity rates associated with gFOBT, in a comparison between the FIT and a high sensitivity gFOBT. Therefore, any screening program considering the use of FIT needs to take these factors into account. </li>
