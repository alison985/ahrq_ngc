	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

	  ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).
<p>
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.
<p>
There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at <a href="http://www.archivebot.com">http://www.archivebot.com</a>.

<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Clinical Effectiveness</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Description of Manufacturer's Search Strategies and Critique</strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer searched an appropriate range of databases that included MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, the Cochrane Library and the major international trials registries. The websites of some Health Technology Assessment and Regulatory Agencies and recent conference proceedings of the major professional ophthalmology organisations were also searched. Searches were initially undertaken in March 2012 and updated in November 2012. The search strategies used for each database are detailed in the manufacturer's submission and were reproducible. The approach adopted by the manufacturer was to search for any publication concerning choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) associated with myopia. No terms relating to the intervention, comparators or study design were included in the strategy. The facets of the search (CNV and myopia) were correctly constructed using both appropriate text and controlled vocabulary terms and were combined using the correct Boolean operators. By adopting this approach, it is likely that the literature search was highly sensitive.</p>
<p>Because these searches were disease-specific without further restriction by intervention or study design, no additional searches were undertaken for the indirect comparisons or adverse events. This seems entirely appropriate.</p>

<p>The ERG undertook an independent literature search. This was more focused, primarily to identify any relevant RCTs, and was carried out on a restricted range of databases: MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE and CENTRAL. These searches were performed in June 2013 and so will have captured additional studies which had been added to the databases after the manufacturer's search in November 2012. The searches are detailed in Appendix 1 of the ERG report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Cost-effectiveness</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Description of Manufacturer's Search Strategies and Critique</strong></p>
<p>The disease-specific searches undertaken for the clinical effectiveness review were used to identify the cost-effectiveness studies. As well as the clinical databases, the appropriate health economic sources were searched and included EconLit and National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED). The manufacturer undertook additional, less focussed searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE for any economic evaluations associated with degenerative or pathological myopia without reference to CNV. The facets for the search (myopia and economic evaluation) were correctly constructed, using the relevant text and controlled vocabulary terms, and were combined correctly with Boolean operators. Reference lists of eligible studies and recent reviews were checked for additional studies. This overall approach was considered by the ERG to be robust and likely to have retrieved the relevant articles.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Economic evaluations of patients undergoing any treatment for PM or CNV secondary to PM (including patients refractory to other therapies) were eligible for inclusion. Relevant outcomes included total, direct and indirect costs, summary health outcomes, utility values, cost-effectiveness ratios and number of cases of blindness.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform an assessment of the manufacturer's submission on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an Evidence Review Group (ERG) report. The ERG report for this technology appraisal was prepared by the Aberdeen Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Group (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Clinical Effectiveness</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Quality Assessment</strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer assessed the quality of the three included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The methods used for quality assessment were considered adequate by the ERG.</p>
<p>Overall, the methodological quality of the Novartis phase III trial was acceptable. Both the methods of randomisation and the treatment allocation concealment were adequate. Randomisation appears to have been successful and demographic and choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) characteristics were balanced across the randomised groups. Study personnel and participants were masked throughout the trial. The only study personnel who were unmasked were those who administered the randomised study treatment when needed, according to the protocol. All outcomes were assessed by masked personnel. The ERG considers the masking strategies used to be appropriate. Analysis was on an intention-to-treat basis. The full analysis set involved a modified last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) approach. The ERG considers this approach to be acceptable in this case.</p>
<p>The quality of the Gharbiya 2010 trial was unclear due to inadequate reporting. Method of randomisation, concealment of treatment allocation and details of any masking were not reported, although it appears that no masking was involved in the trial. Methods of analysis were also not reported, thus it is unclear whether an intention-to-treat approach was used.</p>
<p>The quality of the Iacono 2012 trial was variable. Appropriate randomisation and concealment of treatment allocation procedures were involved. Baseline disease-related characteristics were comparable across treatment groups. The trial was described as &quot;double-blind&quot; but only masking of the study personnel administering the injection was declared. Thus, it is unclear whether masking of participants was achieved. An intention-to-treat approach was used but methods of accounting for missing data were not described.</p>
<p>The ERG performed a quality assessment of the manufacturer's systematic review using the York Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) criteria (see Table 6 in the ERG report [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). The quality of the systematic review was good and the ERG has no major concerns in any of the quality areas.</p>
<p><strong>Critique of Indirect and Mixed Treatment Comparisons</strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer did not present an indirect comparison of ranibizumab with other treatments. Their reason was that there was a head to head trial of ranibizumab versus verteporfin photodynamic therapy (vPDT), the only comparator considered in the submission. As bevacizumab was not included as a comparator they felt it unnecessary to undertake a network meta-analysis. The manufacturer did present a preliminary network analysis including a number of treatments (observation, vPDT, ranibizumab, bevacizumab, laser). However, following clarification, they confirmed it was inappropriate given the heterogeneous nature of the study populations and the differing length of follow ups. Therefore, within the main submission, a network meta-analysis of ranibizumab with treatments other than vPDT was not presented.</p>
<p>See section 4 of the ERG report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for more information on clinical effectiveness.</p>
<p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Cost-effectiveness</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Model Structure</strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer developed a cost utility Markov model with a quarterly cycle and a lifetime horizon. It is principally a one eye model, though some additional costs are included for bilateral disease at baseline. The distribution of the visual acuity of the treated eyes is divided into eight health states, the majority of which span a range of 10 ETDRS letters. The baseline distribution and proportions that have their baseline best seeing eye (BSE) treated are drawn from the Novartis phase III trial.</p>

<p>Technology appraisal recommendations are based on a review of clinical and economic evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Appraisal Process</strong></p>
<p>The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) invites 'consultee' and 'commentator' organisations to take part in the appraisal process. Consultee organisations include national groups representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review. Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to comment on the appraisal documents.</p>
<p>Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service (NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not asked to submit evidence themselves.</p>
<p>NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review published evidence on the technology and prepare an 'assessment report'. Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a document called the evaluation report.</p>
<p>An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the 'appraisal consultation document' (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE website. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.</p>
<p>When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document called the 'final appraisal determination' (FAD). This is submitted to NICE for approval.</p>
<p>Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is on the Appraisal Committee?</strong></p>
<p>NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an independent committee. This includes health professionals working in the NHS and people who are familiar with the issues affecting patients and carers. Although the Appraisal Committee seeks the views of organisations representing health professionals, patients, carers, manufacturers and government, its advice is independent of any vested interests.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;><strong>Summary of Appraisal Committee's Key Conclusions</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Availability and Nature of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The Committee considered the manufacturer's economic model and the critique and exploratory analyses performed by the Evidence Review Group (ERG). It accepted the model structure, but was concerned by some of the uncertainties about the assumptions used by the manufacturer. The Committee noted that the manufacturer had not included bevacizumab as a comparator in its economic model.</p>
<p><strong>Uncertainties Around and Plausibility of Assumptions and Inputs in the Economic Model</strong></p>
<p>The Committee considered the larger proportion of patients with subfoveal involvement in the Verteporfin in Photodynamic Therapy (VIP) trial, which provided the&amp;nbsp;verteporfin photodynamic therapy (vPDT) data after 3 months. However, it concluded that the imbalance between RADIANCE and VIP was unlikely to have a large impact on the manufacturer's model.</p>
<p>The Committee considered the manufacturer's assumption that the average best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) gain at the end of year 1 would continue indefinitely. It concluded that the duration of treatment benefit was likely to be less than the manufacturer's assumption of an indefinite duration, but that ranibizumab dominated vPDT when the duration of effect was reduced.</p>
<p>The Committee discussed whether the manufacturer's assumption about the number of ranibizumab injections that people would receive in clinical practice was too low. It concluded that the number of injections included in the manufacturer's base case could be an underestimate, and that even if the number of injections was increased, the base-case analysis would not be affected.</p>
<p>The Committee discussed whether the costs of blindness used in the manufacturer's model were too high. The Committee noted that the ERG presented lower costs of blindness in their report. The Committee concluded that the ERG's assumptions about the costs of blindness were likely to be more realistic than those used by the manufacturer, and that any changes were unlikely to have a large impact on the base-case analysis.</p>
<p>The Committee discussed whether the administration costs of ranibizumab used in the manufacturer's model were an underestimate. It concluded that the National Health Service (NHS) costs were uncertain, but the uncertainty was not great enough to affect the base-case analysis.</p>
<p>The Committee discussed whether the mortality multipliers used in the manufacturer's economic model were appropriate. It concluded that the manufacturer's rationale for some of the mortality multipliers in the model was unclear, and that any changes to them were unlikely to change the base-case analysis.</p>
<p>The Committee discussed whether the method used in the manufacturer's model to account for the possibility of the treated eye changing from being the better-seeing eye to the worse-seeing eye as patients change health states was appropriate. It concluded that the modelling may have had an impact on the base-case analysis, but the level of impact was unclear.</p>
<p>The Committee considered that Euroqol 5 dimensions (EQ-5D) data were collected in RADIANCE, but were not used in the manufacturer's economic model. It concluded that using the EQ-5D data from RADIANCE was unlikely to change the overall results of the base-case analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Incorporation of Health-Related Quality-of-Life Benefits and Utility Values</strong></p>
<p>The Committee noted that the EQ-5D data collected in RADIANCE was not used in the model and the manufacturer used utility values from Czoski-Murray et al. (2009), in line with previous appraisals of drugs for eye conditions. The Committee heard from the ERG that using the EQ-5D data from RADIANCE did not have had a large effect on the model, although the effect for the worse-seeing eye was not clear. The Committee concluded that using the EQ-5D data from RADIANCE was unlikely to change the overall results of the base-case analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Have Any Potential Significant and Substantial Health-Related Benefits Been Identified That Were Not Included in the Economic Model, and How Have They Been Considered?</strong></p>
<p>The Committee was not aware of any substantial benefits of ranibizumab over its comparators that were not already captured in the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) estimation in the modelling.</p>
<p><strong>Are There Specific Groups of People for Whom the Technology Is Particularly Cost-Effective?</strong></p>
<p>None</p>
<p><strong>What Are the Key Drivers of Cost-Effectiveness?</strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer's sensitivity analyses showed that the cost-effectiveness of ranibizumab was sensitive to changes in the unit cost of ranibizumab and vPDT, the number of ranibizumab injections in the first and second year, the starting age of the patient group, the discount rate for benefits, and the maximum utility gain in the worse-seeing eye.</p>
<p><strong>Most Likely Cost-Effectiveness Estimate (given as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER])</strong></p>
<p>The Committee noted that manufacturer's base-case analysis showed that ranibizumab dominated vPDT (that is, it was more effective and less costly), resulting in more QALYs (13.18 compared with 12.75) and lower costs (&amp;pound;9694 compared with &amp;pound;12,455). The Committee considered the uncertainties in the manufacturer's model and noted that they were unlikely to have an effect on the overall results of the base-case analysis, which showed that ranibizumab dominated vPDT.</p></div>"/>
