Liveweb proxy is a component of Internet Archiveâ€™s wayback machine project. The liveweb proxy captures the content of a web page in real time, archives it into a ARC or WARC file and returns the ARC/WARC record back to the wayback machine to process. The recorded ARC/WARC file becomes part of the wayback machine in due course of time.

<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>&amp;ndash;There is strong evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. Good evidence was found that the intervention improves important outcomes and concludes that benefits substantially outweigh harm.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>&amp;ndash;There is moderate evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. At least fair evidence was found that the intervention improves important outcomes and concludes that benefits outweigh harm.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>&amp;ndash;There is weak evidence that the intervention can improve outcomes, and the balance of the benefits and harms may result either in a recommendation that occupational therapy practitioners routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients or in no recommendation as the balance of the benefits and harm is too close to justify a general recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>&amp;ndash;Recommend that occupational therapy practitioners do not provide the intervention to eligible clients. At least fair evidence was found that the intervention is ineffective or that harm outweighs benefits.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong>&amp;ndash;Insufficient evidence to determine whether or not occupational therapy practitioners should be routinely providing the intervention. Evidence that the intervention is effective is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting and the balance of benefits and harm cannot be determined.</p>

<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>What is the effectiveness of activity-based interventions for mental health promotion, prevention and intervention with children and youth? The interventions include those focused on peer and social interaction; compliance with adult directives and social rules and norms; and participation in productive and task-focused behavior. </li>
</ul>
<p>To conduct the evidence-based literature review, reviewers evaluated research studies published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature according to their quality (scientific rigor and lack of bias) and levels of evidence. The evidence-based reviews incorporated into the American Occupational Therapy Association, Inc. (AOTA) Practice Guidelines consist of a review and ranking of the literature relevant to occupational therapy interventions published since 1980 used to treat a variety of clinical conditions. An initial review covered articles published between 1980 and 2002. An updated review included articles published between 2003 and 2009. In addition, more recent articles covering the period 2010 to 2012 were included on the basis of recommendations from content experts in the field. Specific inclusion criteria were as follows:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>The article was published either in a peer-reviewed journal or in a peer-reviewed evidence-based review since 1980 in the English language. </li>
    <li>The age range of study participants was 3 to 21 years. </li>
    <li>The intervention described in each study was embedded in activities and within the domain of occupational therapy, although it did not have to be a common occupational therapy intervention or administered by an occupational therapist or an occupational therapy assistant. </li>
    <li>The outcomes measured in the study included social or peer interactions or compliance with adult directives or social rules and norms. </li>
    <li>Level I, II, and III evidence (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field). </li>
</ul>
<p>Exclusion criteria were the following:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Presentations and conference proceedings </li>
    <li>Non&amp;ndash;peer-reviewed literature </li>
    <li>Dissertations and theses </li>
    <li>Study did not include an activity-based component </li>
    <li>Study was outside the scope of occupational therapy practice </li>
    <li>Level IV and V evidence </li>
</ul>
<p>Reviewers and AOTA staff first identified search terms, and these were reviewed by the advisory group. The search terms were developed not only to capture pertinent articles but also to make sure that the terms relevant to the specific thesaurus of each database were included. Table B.2 in the original guideline document lists the search terms related to populations and interventions included in each systematic review. For the updated review, additional search terms were added to reflect changes in terminology that had taken place since the earlier review. Search terms for the updated reviews were developed by the consultant to the AOTA Evidence-Based Practice Project and AOTA staff in consultation with the author of the questions and were reviewed by the advisory group. A medical research librarian with experience in completing systematic review searches conducted all updated searches.</p>
<p>The following sources were searched:</p>
<ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;>
    <li>Bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, ERIC, EMBASE, PsycINFO; OTseeker was included in the updated review) </li>
    <li>Consolidated information sources (e.g., evidence-based medicine reviews, including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness) </li>
</ul>
<p>The AOTA consultant completed the initial review of the database results. The updated review was completed by an academic partnership of Susan Nochajski and master's students in occupational therapy at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York. The team of reviewers also scanned the bibliographies of selected key articles.</p></div>"/>

<p>The articles included in the systematic review have several overarching limitations, including the following: small sample size; wide variation in interventions, diagnoses, and clinical conditions; wide variation in outcomes measured; and the use of self-report outcome measures.

<p><strong>A</strong>&amp;ndash;There is strong evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. Good evidence was found that the intervention improves important outcomes and concludes that benefits substantially outweigh harm.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>&amp;ndash;There is moderate evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. At least fair evidence was found that the intervention improves important outcomes and concludes that benefits outweigh harm.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>&amp;ndash;There is weak evidence that the intervention can improve outcomes, and the balance of the benefits and harms may result either in a recommendation that occupational therapy practitioners routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients or in no recommendation as the balance of the benefits and harm is too close to justify a general recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>&amp;ndash;Recommend that occupational therapy practitioners do not provide the intervention to eligible clients. At least fair evidence was found that the intervention is ineffective or that harm outweighs benefits.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong>&amp;ndash;Insufficient evidence to determine whether or not occupational therapy practitioners should be routinely providing the intervention. Evidence that the intervention is effective is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting and the balance of benefits and harm cannot be determined.</p></div>"/>

      <fieldvalue value="<div class=&quot;content_para&quot;><p>It is important to consider the possibility that some well-meaning prevention efforts may be more harmful than beneficial to children who are overweight. Child obesity prevention programs and untested health education messages have the potential to further stigmatize children who are overweight. The majority of children who are overweight are well aware of their body size and are at risk of developing a poor body image. Negatively focused health messages (e.g., that emphasize the undesirability of being overweight) may lead students to feel worse about themselves. Professionals must carefully consider how prevention messages are framed in order to avoid the potential psychosocial (e.g., poor self-esteem) and physical health (e.g., binge dieting) consequences that can result.</p></div>"/>
